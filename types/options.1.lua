-- 	This is a list of directories which will be searched when using the
-- 	|gf|, [f, ]f, ^Wf, |:find|, |:sfind|, |:tabfind| and other commands,
-- 	provided that the file being searched for has a relative path (not
-- 	starting with "/", "./" or "../").  The directories in the 'path'
-- 	option may be relative or absolute.
-- 	- Use commas to separate directory names: >
-- 		:set path=.,/usr/local/include,/usr/include
-- <	- Spaces can also be used to separate directory names (for backwards
-- 	  compatibility with version 3.0).  To have a space in a directory
-- 	  name, precede it with an extra backslash, and escape the space: >
-- 		:set path=.,/dir/with\\\ space
-- <	- To include a comma in a directory name precede it with an extra
-- 	  backslash: >
-- 		:set path=.,/dir/with\\,comma
-- <	- To search relative to the directory of the current file, use: >
-- 		:set path=.
-- <	- To search in the current directory use an empty string between two
-- 	  commas: >
-- 		:set path=,,
-- <	- A directory name may end in a ':' or '/'.
-- 	- Environment variables are expanded |:set_env|.
-- 	- When using |netrw.vim| URLs can be used.  For example, adding
-- 	  "http://www.vim.org" will make ":find index.html" work.
-- 	- Search upwards and downwards in a directory tree using "*", "**" and
-- 	  ";".  See |file-searching| for info and syntax.
-- 	- Careful with '\' characters, type two to get one in the option: >
-- 		:set path=.,c:\\include
-- <	  Or just use '/' instead: >
-- 		:set path=.,c:/include
-- <	Don't forget "." or files won't even be found in the same directory as
-- 	the file!
-- 	The maximum length is limited.  How much depends on the system, mostly
-- 	it is something like 256 or 1024 characters.
-- 	You can check if all the include files are found, using the value of
-- 	'path', see |:checkpath|.
-- 	The use of |:set+=| and |:set-=| is preferred when adding or removing
-- 	directories from the list.  This avoids problems when a future version
-- 	uses another default.  To remove the current directory use: >
-- 		:set path-=
-- <	To add the current directory use: >
-- 		:set path+=
-- <	To use an environment variable, you probably need to replace the
-- 	separator.  Here is an example to append $INCL, in which directory
-- 	names are separated with a semi-colon: >
-- 		:let &path = &path . "," . substitute($INCL, ';', ',', 'g')
-- <	Replace the ';' with a ':' or whatever separator is used.  Note that
-- 	this doesn't work when $INCL contains a comma or white space.

-- 	- Empty means that no swap file will be used (recovery is
-- 	  impossible!) and no |E303| error will be given.
-- 	- A directory "." means to put the swap file in the same directory as
-- 	  the edited file.  On Unix, a dot is prepended to the file name, so
-- 	  it doesn't show in a directory listing.  On MS-Windows the "hidden"
-- 	  attribute is set and a dot prepended if possible.
-- 	- A directory starting with "./" (or ".\" for Windows) means to
-- 	  put the swap file relative to where the edited file is.  The leading
-- 	  "." is replaced with the path name of the edited file.
-- 	- For Unix and Win32, if a directory ends in two path separators "//",
-- 	  the swap file name will be built from the complete path to the file
-- 	  with all path separators substituted to percent '%' signs. This will
-- 	  ensure file name uniqueness in the preserve directory.
-- 	  On Win32, it is also possible to end with "\\".  However, When a
-- 	  separating comma is following, you must use "//", since "\\" will
-- 	  include the comma in the file name. Therefore it is recommended to
-- 	  use '//', instead of '\\'.
-- 	- Spaces after the comma are ignored, other spaces are considered part
-- 	  of the directory name.  To have a space at the start of a directory
-- 	  name, precede it with a backslash.
-- 	- To include a comma in a directory name precede it with a backslash.
-- 	- A directory name may end in an ':' or '/'.
-- 	- Environment variables are expanded |:set_env|.
-- 	- Careful with '\' characters, type one before a space, type two to
-- 	  get one in the option (see |option-backslash|), for example: >

-- <	- For backwards compatibility with Vim version 3.0 a '>' at the start

-- 	Using "." first in the list is recommended.  This means that editing
-- 	the same file twice will result in a warning.  Using "/tmp" on Unix is
-- 	discouraged: When the system crashes you lose the swap file.
-- 	"/var/tmp" is often not cleared when rebooting, thus is a better
-- 	choice than "/tmp".  But it can contain a lot of files, your swap
-- 	files get lost in the crowd.  That is why a "tmp" directory in your
-- 	home directory is tried first.
-- 	The use of |:set+=| and |:set-=| is preferred when adding or removing

-- 	This is a list of character encodings considered when starting to edit
-- 	an existing file.  When a file is read, Vim tries to use the first
-- 	mentioned character encoding.  If an error is detected, the next one
-- 	in the list is tried.  When an encoding is found that works,
-- 	'fileencoding' is set to it.  If all fail, 'fileencoding' is set to
-- 	an empty string, which means that UTF-8 is used.
-- 		WARNING: Conversion can cause loss of information! You can use
-- 		the |++bad| argument to specify what is done with characters
-- 		that can't be converted.
-- 	For an empty file or a file with only ASCII characters most encodings
-- 	will work and the first entry of 'fileencodings' will be used (except
-- 	"ucs-bom", which requires the BOM to be present).  If you prefer
-- 	another encoding use an BufReadPost autocommand event to test if your
-- 	preferred encoding is to be used.  Example: >
-- 		au BufReadPost * if search('\S', 'w') == 0 |
-- 			\ set fenc=iso-2022-jp | endif
-- <	This sets 'fileencoding' to "iso-2022-jp" if the file does not contain
-- 	non-blank characters.
-- 	When the |++enc| argument is used then the value of 'fileencodings' is
-- 	not used.
-- 	Note that 'fileencodings' is not used for a new file, the global value
-- 	of 'fileencoding' is used instead.  You can set it with: >
-- 		:setglobal fenc=iso-8859-2
-- <	This means that a non-existing file may get a different encoding than
-- 	an empty file.
-- 	The special value "ucs-bom" can be used to check for a Unicode BOM
-- 	(Byte Order Mark) at the start of the file.  It must not be preceded
-- 	by "utf-8" or another Unicode encoding for this to work properly.
-- 	An entry for an 8-bit encoding (e.g., "latin1") should be the last,
-- 	because Vim cannot detect an error, thus the encoding is always
-- 	accepted.
-- 	The special value "default" can be used for the encoding from the
-- 	environment.  It is useful when your environment uses a non-latin1
-- 	encoding, such as Russian.
-- 	When a file contains an illegal UTF-8 byte sequence it won't be
-- 	recognized as "utf-8".  You can use the |8g8| command to find the
-- 	illegal byte sequence.
-- 	WRONG VALUES:			WHAT'S WRONG:
-- 		latin1,utf-8		"latin1" will always be used
-- 		utf-8,ucs-bom,latin1	BOM won't be recognized in an utf-8
-- 					file
-- 		cp1250,latin1		"cp1250" will always be used
-- 	If 'fileencodings' is empty, 'fileencoding' is not modified.
-- 	See 'fileencoding' for the possible values.
-- 	Setting this option does not have an effect until the next time a file
-- 	is read.

--
-- 		The "off" number is only used when 'virtualedit' is set. Then
-- 		it is the offset in screen columns from the start of the

-- 		character.
--
-- 		The "curswant" number is only used when setting the cursor

-- 			<sfile>		sourced script file or function name
-- 			<slnum>		sourced script line number or function
-- 					line number
-- 			<sflnum>	script file line number, also when in
-- 					a function
-- 			<cword>		word under the cursor
-- 			<cWORD>		WORD under the cursor
-- 			<client>	the {clientid} of the last received

-- 			:h		head (last path component removed)
-- 			:t		tail (last path component only)
-- 			:r		root (one extension removed)
-- 			:e		extension only
--

-- 			:let doesntwork = expand("%:h.bak")
-- <		Use this: >

-- <
-- 		There cannot be white space between the variables and the
-- 		following modifier.  The |fnamemodify()| function can be used
-- 		to modify normal file names.
--
-- 		When using '%' or '#', and the current or alternate file name
-- 		is not defined, an empty string is used.  Using "%:p" in a
-- 		buffer with no name, results in the current directory, with a
-- 		'/' added.
--
-- 		When {expr} does not start with '%', '#' or '<', it is
-- 		expanded like a file name is expanded on the command line.
-- 		'suffixes' and 'wildignore' are used, unless the optional
-- 		{nosuf} argument is given and it is |TRUE|.
-- 		Names for non-existing files are included.  The "**" item can
-- 		be used to search in a directory tree.  For example, to find

-- 		expand() can also be used to expand variables and environment
-- 		variables that are only known in a shell.  But this can be
-- 		slow, because a shell may be used to do the expansion.  See
-- 		|expr-env-expand|.
-- 		The expanded variable is still handled like a list of file
-- 		names.  When an environment variable cannot be expanded, it is
-- 		left unchanged.  Thus ":echo expand('$FOOBAR')" results in
-- 		"$FOOBAR".
--
-- 		See |glob()| for finding existing files.  See |system()| for

--
-- 		{options} is a Dictionary with the following optional entries:
-- 		  "vertical"	When TRUE, the split is created vertically,
-- 				like with |:vsplit|.
-- 		  "rightbelow"	When TRUE, the split is made below or to the
-- 				right (if vertical).  When FALSE, it is done
-- 				above or to the left (if vertical).  When not

-- Close the "in" part of {handle}.  See |channel-close-in|.

-- 			GetChannel()->ch_close_in()
--- @return none
function vim.fn.ch_close_in(handle) end

-- Return a list containing the number values which represent

-- 			str2list(" ")		returns [32]
-- 			str2list("ABC")		returns [65, 66, 67]
-- <		|list2str()| does the opposite.
--
-- 		When {utf8} is omitted or zero, the current 'encoding' is used.
-- 		With {utf8} set to 1, always treat the String as utf-8

-- {expr1} must be a |List| or a |Dictionary|.
-- 		For each item in {expr1} evaluate {expr2} and when the result
-- 		is zero remove the item from the |List| or |Dictionary|.
-- 		{expr2} must be a |string| or |Funcref|.
--
-- 		If {expr2} is a |string|, inside {expr2} |v:val| has the value
-- 		of the current item.  For a |Dictionary| |v:key| has the key
-- 		of the current item and for a |List| |v:key| has the index of
-- 		the current item.
-- 		For a |Dictionary| |v:key| has the key of the current item.
-- 		Examples: >
-- 			call filter(mylist, 'v:val !~ "OLD"')
-- <		Removes the items where "OLD" appears. >
-- 			call filter(mydict, 'v:key >= 8')
-- <		Removes the items with a key below 8. >
-- 			call filter(var, 0)
-- <		Removes all the items, thus clears the |List| or |Dictionary|.
--
-- 		Note that {expr2} is the result of expression and is then
-- 		used as an expression again.  Often it is good to use a
-- 		|literal-string| to avoid having to double backslashes.
--
-- 		If {expr2} is a |Funcref| it must take two arguments:
-- 			1. the key or the index of the current item.
-- 			2. the value of the current item.
-- 		The function must return |TRUE| if the item should be kept.
-- 		Example that keeps the odd items of a list: >
-- 			func Odd(idx, val)
-- 			  return a:idx % 2 == 1
-- 			endfunc
-- 			call filter(mylist, function('Odd'))
-- <		It is shorter when using a |lambda|: >
-- 			call filter(myList, {idx, val -> idx * val <= 42})
-- <		If you do not use "val" you can leave it out: >
-- 			call filter(myList, {idx -> idx % 2 == 1})
-- <
-- 		The operation is done in-place.  If you want a |List| or
-- 		|Dictionary| to remain unmodified make a copy first: >
-- 			:let l = filter(copy(mylist), 'v:val =~ "KEEP"')
--
-- <		Returns {expr1}, the |List| or |Dictionary| that was filtered.
-- 		When an error is encountered while evaluating {expr2} no
-- 		further items in {expr1} are processed. When {expr2} is a
-- 		Funcref errors inside a function are ignored, unless it was
-- 		defined with the "abort" flag.

-- Remove the text property type {name}.  When text properties
-- 		using the type {name} are still in place, they will not have

--
-- 		{props} can contain a "bufnr" item.  When it is given, delete
-- 		a property type from this buffer instead of from the global
-- 		property types.
--
-- 		When text property type {name} is not found there is no error.
--
-- 		See |text-properties| for information about text properties.
--
-- 		Can also be used as a |method|: >
-- 			GetPropName()->prop_type_delete()
--- @return none
function vim.fn.prop_type_delete(name, props) end

-- Stop |job-id| {id} by sending SIGTERM to the job process. If
-- 		the process does not terminate after a timeout then SIGKILL
-- 		will be sent. When the job terminates its |on_exit| handler
-- 		(if any) will be invoked.
-- 		See |job-control|.
--

-- 		exited or stopped.
--- @return number
function vim.fn.jobstop(id) end

-- Get the amount of indent for line {lnum} according the lisp
-- 		indenting rules, as with 'lisp'.
-- 		The indent is counted in spaces, the value of 'tabstop' is
-- 		relevant.  {lnum} is used just like in |getline()|.
-- 		When {lnum} is invalid or Vim was not compiled the
-- 		|+lispindent| feature, -1 is returned.
--- @return number
function vim.fn.lispindent(lnum) end

-- Return the largest integral value less than or equal to
-- 		{expr} as a |Float| (round down).

-- Set prompt callback for buffer {buf} to {expr}.  When {expr}
-- 		is an empty string the callback is removed.  This has only
-- 		effect if {buf} has 'buftype' set to "prompt".
--
-- 		The callback is invoked when pressing Enter.  The current
-- 		buffer will always be the prompt buffer.  A new line for a
-- 		prompt is added before invoking the callback, thus the prompt
-- 		for which the callback was invoked will be in the last but one
-- 		line.
-- 		If the callback wants to add text to the buffer, it must
-- 		insert it above the last line, since that is where the current
-- 		prompt is.  This can also be done asynchronously.
-- 		The callback is invoked with one argument, which is the text
-- 		that was entered at the prompt.  This can be an empty string
-- 		if the user only typed Enter.
-- 		Example: >
-- 		   call prompt_setcallback(bufnr(''), function('s:TextEntered'))

-- Return the byte count from the start of the buffer for line
-- 		{lnum}.  This includes the end-of-line character, depending on
-- 		the 'fileformat' option for the current buffer.  The first
-- 		line returns 1. UTF-8 encoding is used, 'fileencoding' is
-- 		ignored.  This can also be used to get the byte count for the
-- 		line just below the last line: >
-- 			line2byte(line("$") + 1)
-- <		This is the buffer size plus one.  If 'fileencoding' is empty
-- 		it is the file size plus one.

-- With no arguments the result is a String, which is the name of
-- 		the current effective working directory. With {winnr} or
-- 		{tabnr} the working directory of that scope is returned.
-- 		Tabs and windows are identified by their respective numbers,
-- 		0 means current tab or window. Missing argument implies 0.
-- 		Thus the following are equivalent: >
-- 			getcwd()
-- 			getcwd(0)
-- 			getcwd(0, 0)
-- <		If {winnr} is -1 it is ignored, only the tab is resolved.
-- 		{winnr} can be the window number or the |window-ID|.
--- @return string

-- <
--- @return number
function vim.fn.libcallnr(lib, func, arg) end

-- Without {end} the result is a String, which is line {lnum}
-- 		from the current buffer.  Example: >

-- <		When {lnum} is a String that doesn't start with a
-- 		digit, |line()| is called to translate the String into a Number.
-- 		To get the line under the cursor: >
-- 			getline(".")
-- <		When {lnum} is smaller than 1 or bigger than the number of
-- 		lines in the buffer, an empty string is returned.
--
-- 		When {end} is given the result is a |List| where each item is
-- 		a line from the current buffer in the range {lnum} to {end},
-- 		including line {end}.
-- 		{end} is used in the same way as {lnum}.
-- 		Non-existing lines are silently omitted.
-- 		When {end} is before {lnum} an empty |List| is returned.
-- 		Example: >
-- 			:let start = line('.')

-- 		then the value is appended.
-- 		{options} can also contain a register type specification:
-- 		    "c" or "v"	      |charwise| mode
-- 		    "l" or "V"	      |linewise| mode
-- 		    "b" or "<CTRL-V>" |blockwise-visual| mode
-- 		If a number immediately follows "b" or "<CTRL-V>" then this is
-- 		used as the width of the selection - if it is not specified
-- 		then the width of the block is set to the number of characters
-- 		in the longest line (counting a <Tab> as 1 character).
-- 		If {options} contains "u" or '"', then the unnamed register is
-- 		set to point to register {regname}.
--
-- 		If {options} contains no register settings, then the default
-- 		is to use character mode unless {value} ends in a <NL> for
-- 		string {value} and linewise mode for list {value}. Blockwise
-- 		mode is never selected automatically.
-- 		Returns zero for success, non-zero for failure.
--
-- 							*E883*
-- 		Note: you may not use |List| containing more than one item to
-- 		      set search and expression registers. Lists containing no
-- 		      items act like empty strings.
--
-- 		Examples: >
-- 			:call setreg(v:register, @*)
-- 			:call setreg('*', @%, 'ac')
-- 			:call setreg('a', "1\n2\n3", 'b5')
--
-- <		This example shows using the functions to save and restore a

-- 			:let var_amode = getregtype('a')
-- 			    ....
-- 			:call setreg('a', var_a, var_amode)
-- <		Note: you may not reliably restore register value
-- 		without using the third argument to |getreg()| as without it
-- 		newlines are represented as newlines AND Nul bytes are
-- 		represented as newlines as well, see |NL-used-for-Nul|.

-- Escape {string} for use as a shell command argument.

-- 		replace all "'" with "'\''".
--
-- 		When the {special} argument is present and it's a non-zero
-- 		Number or a non-empty String (|non-zero-arg|), then special
-- 		items such as "!", "%", "#" and "<cword>" will be preceded by
-- 		a backslash.  This backslash will be removed again by the |:!|
-- 		command.
--
-- 		The "!" character will be escaped (again with a |non-zero-arg|
-- 		{special}) when 'shell' contains "csh" in the tail.  That is
-- 		because for csh and tcsh "!" is used for history replacement
-- 		even when inside single quotes.
--
-- 		With a |non-zero-arg| {special} the <NL> character is also
-- 		escaped.  When 'shell' containing "csh" in the tail it's
-- 		escaped a second time.
--
-- 		Example of use with a |:!| command: >
-- 		    :exe '!dir ' . shellescape(expand('<cfile>'), 1)
-- <		This results in a directory listing for the file under the

-- 		  %x	hex number
-- 		  %04x	hex number padded with zeros to at least 4 characters
-- 		  %X	hex number using upper case letters
-- 		  %o	octal number
-- 		  %f	floating point number as 12.23, inf, -inf or nan
-- 		  %F	floating point number as 12.23, INF, -INF or NAN
-- 		  %e	floating point number as 1.23e3, inf, -inf or nan
-- 		  %E	floating point number as 1.23E3, INF, -INF or NAN
-- 		  %g	floating point number, as %f or %e depending on value
-- 		  %G	floating point number, as %F or %E depending on value
-- 		  %%	the % character itself
-- 		  %p	representation of the pointer to the container
--
-- 		Conversion specifications start with '%' and end with the
-- 		conversion type.  All other characters are copied unchanged to
-- 		the result.
--
-- 		The "%" starts a conversion specification.  The following
-- 		arguments appear in sequence:
--
-- 			%  [flags]  [field-width]  [.precision]  type
--
-- 		flags
-- 			Zero or more of the following flags:
--
-- 		    #	      The value should be converted to an "alternate
-- 			      form".  For c, d, and s conversions, this option
-- 			      has no effect.  For o conversions, the precision
-- 			      of the number is increased to force the first
-- 			      character of the output string to a zero (except
-- 			      if a zero value is printed with an explicit
-- 			      precision of zero).
-- 			      For x and X conversions, a non-zero result has
-- 			      the string "0x" (or "0X" for X conversions)
-- 			      prepended to it.
--
-- 		    0 (zero)  Zero padding.  For all conversions the converted
-- 			      value is padded on the left with zeros rather
-- 			      than blanks.  If a precision is given with a
-- 			      numeric conversion (d, o, x, and X), the 0 flag
-- 			      is ignored.
--
-- 		    -	      A negative field width flag; the converted value
-- 			      is to be left adjusted on the field boundary.
-- 			      The converted value is padded on the right with
-- 			      blanks, rather than on the left with blanks or
-- 			      zeros.  A - overrides a 0 if both are given.
--
-- 		    ' ' (space)  A blank should be left before a positive
-- 			      number produced by a signed conversion (d).
--
-- 		    +	      A sign must always be placed before a number
-- 			      produced by a signed conversion.  A + overrides
-- 			      a space if both are used.
--
-- 		field-width
-- 			An optional decimal digit string specifying a minimum
-- 			field width.  If the converted value has fewer bytes
-- 			than the field width, it will be padded with spaces on
-- 			the left (or right, if the left-adjustment flag has
-- 			been given) to fill out the field width.
--
-- 		.precision
-- 			An optional precision, in the form of a period '.'
-- 			followed by an optional digit string.  If the digit
-- 			string is omitted, the precision is taken as zero.
-- 			This gives the minimum number of digits to appear for
-- 			d, o, x, and X conversions, or the maximum number of
-- 			bytes to be printed from a string for s conversions.
-- 			For floating point it is the number of digits after
-- 			the decimal point.
--
-- 		type
-- 			A character that specifies the type of conversion to
-- 			be applied, see below.
--
-- 		A field width or precision, or both, may be indicated by an
-- 		asterisk '*' instead of a digit string.  In this case, a
-- 		Number argument supplies the field width or precision.  A
-- 		negative field width is treated as a left adjustment flag
-- 		followed by a positive field width; a negative precision is
-- 		treated as though it were missing.  Example: >
-- 			:echo printf("%d: %.*s", nr, width, line)
-- <		This limits the length of the text used from "line" to
-- 		"width" bytes.
--
-- 		The conversion specifiers and their meanings are:
--
-- 				*printf-d* *printf-b* *printf-B* *printf-o* *printf-x* *printf-X*
-- 		dbBoxX	The Number argument is converted to signed decimal (d),
-- 			unsigned binary (b and B), unsigned octal (o), or
-- 			unsigned hexadecimal (x and X) notation.  The letters
-- 			"abcdef" are used for x conversions; the letters
-- 			"ABCDEF" are used for X conversions.  The precision, if
-- 			any, gives the minimum number of digits that must
-- 			appear; if the converted value requires fewer digits, it
-- 			is padded on the left with zeros.  In no case does a
-- 			non-existent or small field width cause truncation of a
-- 			numeric field; if the result of a conversion is wider
-- 			than the field width, the field is expanded to contain
-- 			the conversion result.
-- 			The 'h' modifier indicates the argument is 16 bits.
-- 			The 'l' modifier indicates the argument is 32 bits.
-- 			The 'L' modifier indicates the argument is 64 bits.
-- 			Generally, these modifiers are not useful. They are
-- 			ignored when type is known from the argument.

-- 		O	alias for lo
--
-- 							*printf-c*
-- 		c	The Number argument is converted to a byte, and the
-- 			resulting character is written.
--
-- 							*printf-s*
-- 		s	The text of the String argument is used.  If a
-- 			precision is specified, no more bytes than the number
-- 			specified are used.
-- 			If the argument is not a String type, it is
-- 			automatically converted to text with the same format
-- 			as ":echo".
-- 							*printf-S*
-- 		S	The text of the String argument is used.  If a
-- 			precision is specified, no more display cells than the
-- 			number specified are used.
--
-- 							*printf-f* *E807*
-- 		f F	The Float argument is converted into a string of the
-- 			form 123.456.  The precision specifies the number of
-- 			digits after the decimal point.  When the precision is
-- 			zero the decimal point is omitted.  When the precision
-- 			is not specified 6 is used.  A really big number
-- 			(out of range or dividing by zero) results in "inf"
-- 			 or "-inf" with %f (INF or -INF with %F).
-- 			 "0.0 / 0.0" results in "nan" with %f (NAN with %F).
-- 			Example: >
-- 				echo printf("%.2f", 12.115)
-- <				12.12
-- 			Note that roundoff depends on the system libraries.
-- 			Use |round()| when in doubt.
--
-- 							*printf-e* *printf-E*
-- 		e E	The Float argument is converted into a string of the
-- 			form 1.234e+03 or 1.234E+03 when using 'E'.  The
-- 			precision specifies the number of digits after the
-- 			decimal point, like with 'f'.
--
-- 							*printf-g* *printf-G*
-- 		g G	The Float argument is converted like with 'f' if the
-- 			value is between 0.001 (inclusive) and 10000000.0
-- 			(exclusive).  Otherwise 'e' is used for 'g' and 'E'
-- 			for 'G'.  When no precision is specified superfluous
-- 			zeroes and '+' signs are removed, except for the zero
-- 			immediately after the decimal point.  Thus 10000000.0
-- 			results in 1.0e7.
--
-- 							*printf-%*
-- 		%	A '%' is written.  No argument is converted.  The
-- 			complete conversion specification is "%%".
--
-- 		When a Number argument is expected a String argument is also
-- 		accepted and automatically converted.
-- 		When a Float or String argument is expected a Number argument
-- 		is also accepted and automatically converted.
-- 		Any other argument type results in an error message.
--
-- 							*E766* *E767*
-- 		The number of {exprN} arguments must exactly match the number
-- 		of "%" items.  If there are not sufficient or too many
-- 		arguments an error is given.  Up to 18 arguments can be used.
--- @return string
function vim.fn.printf(fmt, ...) end

-- The result is the swap file path of the buffer {expr}.
-- 		For the use of {expr}, see |bufname()| above.
-- 		If buffer {expr} is the current buffer, the result is equal to
-- 		|:swapname| (unless no swap file).
-- 		If buffer {expr} has no swap file, returns an empty string.
--- @return string
function vim.fn.swapname(expr) end

-- Get a list of defined signs and their attributes.
-- 		This is similar to the |:sign-list| command.
--
-- 		If the {name} is not supplied, then a list of all the defined
-- 		signs is returned. Otherwise the attribute of the specified
-- 		sign is returned.
--
-- 		Each list item in the returned value is a dictionary with the
-- 		following entries:
-- 			icon	full path to the bitmap file of the sign
-- 			linehl	highlight group used for the whole line the
-- 				sign is placed in.
-- 			name	name of the sign
-- 			text	text that is displayed when there is no icon
-- 				or the GUI is not being used.
-- 			texthl	highlight group used for the text item
-- 			numhl	highlight group used for 'number' column at the
-- 				associated line. Overrides |hl-LineNr|,
-- 				|hl-CursorLineNr|.
--
-- 		Returns an empty List if there are no signs and when {name} is
-- 		not found.
--
-- 		Examples: >
-- 			" Get a list of all the defined signs
-- 			echo sign_getdefined()
--
-- 			" Get the attribute of the sign named mySign
-- 			echo sign_getdefined("mySign")
--- @return list
function vim.fn.sign_getdefined(name) end

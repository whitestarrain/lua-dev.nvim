-- 		Also see |sub-replace-expression|.
--
-- 		If {list} is present and non-zero then submatch() returns

-- 		NL characters in the text represent NUL characters in the

-- 		Only returns more than one item for |:substitute|, inside
-- 		|substitute()| this list will always contain one or zero
-- 		items, since there are no real line breaks.
--
-- 		When substitute() is used recursively only the submatches in

--
-- 		Examples: >

--
-- 		This works like the ":substitute" command (without any flags).
-- 		But the matching with {pat} is always done like the 'magic'
-- 		option is set and 'cpoptions' is empty (to make scripts
-- 		portable).  'ignorecase' is still relevant, use |/\c| or |/\C|
-- 		if you want to ignore or match case and ignore 'ignorecase'.
-- 		'smartcase' is not used.  See |string-match| for how {pat} is
-- 		used.
--
-- 		A "~" in {sub} is not replaced with the previous {sub}.
-- 		Note that some codes in {sub} have a special meaning
-- 		|sub-replace-special|.  For example, to replace something with
-- 		"\n" (two characters), use "\\\\n" or '\\n'.
--
-- 		When {pat} does not match in {expr}, {expr} is returned
-- 		unmodified.
--
-- 		Example: >
-- 			:let &path = substitute(&path, ",\\=[^,]*$", "", "")
-- <		This removes the last component of the 'path' option. >
-- 			:echo substitute("testing", ".*", "\\U\\0", "")
-- <		results in "TESTING".
--
-- 		When {sub} starts with "\=", the remainder is interpreted as
-- 		an expression. See |sub-replace-expression|.  Example: >
-- 			:echo substitute(s, '%\(\x\x\)',
-- 			   \ '\=nr2char("0x" . submatch(1))', 'g')
--
-- <		When {sub} is a Funcref that function is called, with one
-- 		optional argument.  Example: >
-- 		   :echo substitute(s, '%\(\x\x\)', SubNr, 'g')
-- <		The optional argument is a list which contains the whole
-- 		matched string and up to nine submatches, like what

-- 		If {input} is a string it is written to a pipe and passed as
-- 		stdin to the command.  The string is written as-is, line
-- 		separators are not changed.
-- 		If {input} is a |List| it is written to the pipe as
-- 		|writefile()| does with {binary} set to "b" (i.e. with
-- 		a newline between each list item, and newlines inside list
-- 		items converted to NULs).
-- 		When {input} is given and is a valid buffer id, the content of
-- 		the buffer is written to the file line by line, each line
-- 		terminated by NL (and NUL where the text has NL).
-- 								*E5677*
-- 		Note: system() cannot write to or read from backgrounded ("&")
-- 		shell commands, e.g.: >
-- 		    :echo system("cat - &", "foo"))
-- <		which is equivalent to: >
-- 		    $ echo foo | bash -c 'cat - &'
-- <		The pipes are disconnected (unless overridden by shell
-- 		redirection syntax) before input can reach it. Use
-- 		|jobstart()| instead.
--
-- 		Note: Use |shellescape()| or |::S| with |expand()| or
-- 		|fnamemodify()| to escape special characters in a command
-- 		argument.  Newlines in {cmd} may cause the command to fail.
-- 		The characters in 'shellquote' and 'shellxquote' may also
-- 		cause trouble.
--
-- 		Result is a String.  Example: >
-- 		    :let files = system("ls " .  shellescape(expand('%:h')))
-- 		    :let files = system('ls ' . expand('%:h:S'))
--
-- <		To make the result more system-independent, the shell output
-- 		is filtered to replace <CR> with <NL> for Macintosh, and
-- 		<CR><NL> with <NL> for DOS-like systems.
-- 		To avoid the string being truncated at a NUL, all NUL
-- 		characters are replaced with SOH (0x01).
--
-- 		The command executed is constructed using several options when
-- 		{cmd} is a string: 'shell' 'shellcmdflag' {cmd}
--
-- 		The resulting error code can be found in |v:shell_error|.
-- 		This function will fail in |restricted-mode|.
--
-- 		Note that any wrong value in the options mentioned above may
-- 		make the function fail.  It has also been reported to fail

-- Return a string which contains characters indicating the

-- 		  Yes: then do it right away.
-- 		  No:  add to work queue and add a |SafeState| and/or
-- 		       |SafeStateAgain| autocommand (|SafeState| triggers at
-- 		       toplevel, |SafeStateAgain| triggers after handling
-- 		       messages and callbacks).
-- 		- When SafeState or SafeStateAgain is triggered and executes
-- 		  your autocommand, check with `state()` if the work can be
-- 		  done now, and if yes remove it from the queue and execute.
-- 		  Remove the autocommand if the queue is now empty.

-- 		Limitations:

-- 		2. `_TYPE` key is one of the types found in |v:msgpack_types|

-- 		   contains name of the key from |v:msgpack_types|):
--
-- 		Key	Value ~
-- 		nil	Zero, ignored when dumping.  Not returned by
-- 			|msgpackparse()| since |v:null| was introduced.
-- 		boolean	One or zero.  When dumping it is only checked that
-- 			value is a |Number|.  Not returned by |msgpackparse()|
-- 			since |v:true| and |v:false| were introduced.
-- 		integer	|List| with four numbers: sign (-1 or 1), highest two
-- 			bits, number with bits from 62nd to 31st, lowest 31
-- 			bits. I.e. to get actual number one will need to use
-- 			code like >
-- 				_VAL[0] * ((_VAL[1] << 62)
-- 				           & (_VAL[2] << 31)
-- 				           & _VAL[3])
-- <			Special dictionary with this type will appear in
-- 			|msgpackparse()| output under one of the following
-- 			circumstances:
-- 			1. |Number| is 32-bit and value is either above
-- 			   INT32_MAX or below INT32_MIN.
-- 			2. |Number| is 64-bit and value is above INT64_MAX. It
-- 			   cannot possibly be below INT64_MIN because msgpack
-- 			   C parser does not support such values.
-- 		float	|Float|. This value cannot possibly appear in
-- 			|msgpackparse()| output.
-- 		string	|readfile()|-style list of strings. This value will
-- 			appear in |msgpackparse()| output if string contains
-- 			zero byte or if string is a mapping key and mapping is
-- 			being represented as special dictionary for other
-- 			reasons.
-- 		binary	|readfile()|-style list of strings. This value will
-- 			appear in |msgpackparse()| output if binary string
-- 			contains zero byte.
-- 		array	|List|. This value cannot appear in |msgpackparse()|
-- 			output.
-- 							*msgpack-special-map*
-- 		map	|List| of |List|s with two items (key and value) each.
-- 			This value will appear in |msgpackparse()| output if

-- 			   are binary strings).
-- 			2. String with NUL byte inside.
-- 			3. Duplicate key.

--                    from other clients, or user interactions (however API
--                    methods may trigger autocommands or event processing which

-- Confirm() offers the user a dialog, from which a choice can be
-- 		made.  It returns the number of the choice.  For the first
-- 		choice this is 1.
--
-- 		{msg} is displayed in a dialog with {choices} as the
-- 		alternatives.  When {choices} is missing or empty, "&OK" is
-- 		used (and translated).
-- 		{msg} is a String, use '\n' to include a newline.  Only on
-- 		some systems the string is wrapped when it doesn't fit.
--
-- 		{choices} is a String, with the individual choices separated
-- 		by '\n', e.g. >
-- 			confirm("Save changes?", "&Yes\n&No\n&Cancel")
-- <		The letter after the '&' is the shortcut key for that choice.
-- 		Thus you can type 'c' to select "Cancel".  The shortcut does
-- 		not need to be the first letter: >
-- 			confirm("file has been modified", "&Save\nSave &All")
-- <		For the console, the first letter of each choice is used as
-- 		the default shortcut key.
--
-- 		The optional {default} argument is the number of the choice
-- 		that is made if the user hits <CR>.  Use 1 to make the first
-- 		choice the default one.  Use 0 to not set a default.  If
-- 		{default} is omitted, 1 is used.
--
-- 		The optional {type} argument gives the type of dialog.  This
-- 		is only used for the icon of the Win32 GUI.  It can be one of
-- 		these values: "Error", "Question", "Info", "Warning" or
-- 		"Generic".  Only the first character is relevant.
-- 		When {type} is omitted, "Generic" is used.
--
-- 		If the user aborts the dialog by pressing <Esc>, CTRL-C,
-- 		or another valid interrupt key, confirm() returns 0.
--
-- 		An example: >
--    :let choice = confirm("What do you want?", "&Apples\n&Oranges\n&Bananas", 2)
--    :if choice == 0
--    :	echo "make up your mind!"
--    :elseif choice == 3

-- <		In a GUI dialog, buttons are used.  The layout of the buttons
-- 		depends on the 'v' flag in 'guioptions'.  If it is included,
-- 		the buttons are always put vertically.  Otherwise,  confirm()
-- 		tries to put the buttons in one horizontal line.  If they
-- 		don't fit, a vertical layout is used anyway.  For some systems
-- 		the horizontal layout is always used.

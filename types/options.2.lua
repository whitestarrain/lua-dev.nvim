-- 	!	When included, save and restore global variables that start
-- 		with an uppercase letter, and don't contain a lowercase
-- 		letter.  Thus "KEEPTHIS and "K_L_M" are stored, but "KeepThis"
-- 		and "_K_L_M" are not.  Nested List and Dict items may not be
-- 		read back correctly, you end up with an empty item.
-- 							*viminfo-quote*
-- 	"	Maximum number of lines saved for each register.  Old name of
-- 		the '<' item, with the disadvantage that you need to put a
-- 		backslash before the ", otherwise it will be recognized as the
-- 		start of a comment!
-- 							*viminfo-%*
-- 	%	When included, save and restore the buffer list.  If Vim is
-- 		started with a file name argument, the buffer list is not
-- 		restored.  If Vim is started without a file name argument, the
-- 		buffer list is restored from the viminfo file.  Quickfix
-- 		('buftype'), unlisted ('buflisted'), unnamed and buffers on
-- 		removable media (|viminfo-r|) are not saved.
-- 		When followed by a number, the number specifies the maximum
-- 		number of buffers that are stored.  Without a number all
-- 		buffers are stored.
-- 							*viminfo-'*
-- 	'	Maximum number of previously edited files for which the marks
-- 		are remembered.  This parameter must always be included when
-- 		'viminfo' is non-empty.
-- 		Including this item also means that the |jumplist| and the
-- 		|changelist| are stored in the viminfo file.
-- 							*viminfo-/*
-- 	/	Maximum number of items in the search pattern history to be
-- 		saved.  If non-zero, then the previous search and substitute
-- 		patterns are also saved.  When not included, the value of
-- 		'history' is used.
-- 							*viminfo-:*
-- 	:	Maximum number of items in the command-line history to be
-- 		saved.  When not included, the value of 'history' is used.
-- 							*viminfo-<*
-- 	<	Maximum number of lines saved for each register.  If zero then
-- 		registers are not saved.  When not included, all lines are
-- 		saved.  '"' is the old name for this item.
-- 		Also see the 's' item below: limit specified in Kbyte.
-- 							*viminfo-@*
-- 	@	Maximum number of items in the input-line history to be
-- 		saved.  When not included, the value of 'history' is used.
-- 							*viminfo-c*
-- 	c	When included, convert the text in the viminfo file from the
-- 		'encoding' used when writing the file to the current
-- 		'encoding'.  See |viminfo-encoding|.
-- 							*viminfo-f*
-- 	f	Whether file marks need to be stored.  If zero, file marks ('0
-- 		to '9, 'A to 'Z) are not stored.  When not present or when
-- 		non-zero, they are all stored.  '0 is used for the current
-- 		cursor position (when exiting or when doing ":wviminfo").
-- 							*viminfo-h*
-- 	h	Disable the effect of 'hlsearch' when loading the viminfo
-- 		file.  When not included, it depends on whether ":nohlsearch"
-- 		has been used since the last search command.
-- 							*viminfo-n*
-- 	n	Name of the viminfo file.  The name must immediately follow
-- 		the 'n'.  Must be at the end of the option!  If the
-- 		'viminfofile' option is set, that file name overrides the one
-- 		given here with 'viminfo'.  Environment variables are
-- 		expanded when opening the file, not when setting the option.
-- 							*viminfo-r*
-- 	r	Removable media.  The argument is a string (up to the next
-- 		',').  This parameter can be given several times.  Each
-- 		specifies the start of a path for which no marks will be
-- 		stored.  This is to avoid removable media.  For MS-DOS you
-- 		could use "ra:,rb:", for Amiga "rdf0:,rdf1:,rdf2:".  You can
-- 		also use it for temp files, e.g., for Unix: "r/tmp".  Case is
-- 		ignored.  Maximum length of each 'r' argument is 50
-- 		characters.
-- 							*viminfo-s*
-- 	s	Maximum size of an item in Kbyte.  If zero then registers are
-- 		not saved.  Currently only applies to registers.  The default
-- 		"s10" will exclude registers with more than 10 Kbyte of text.
-- 		Also see the '<' item above: line count limit.

-- 	- Empty means that no swap file will be used (recovery is
-- 	  impossible!) and no |E303| error will be given.
-- 	- A directory "." means to put the swap file in the same directory as
-- 	  the edited file.  On Unix, a dot is prepended to the file name, so
-- 	  it doesn't show in a directory listing.  On MS-Windows the "hidden"
-- 	  attribute is set and a dot prepended if possible.
-- 	- A directory starting with "./" (or ".\" for Windows) means to
-- 	  put the swap file relative to where the edited file is.  The leading
-- 	  "." is replaced with the path name of the edited file.
-- 	- For Unix and Win32, if a directory ends in two path separators "//",
-- 	  the swap file name will be built from the complete path to the file
-- 	  with all path separators substituted to percent '%' signs. This will
-- 	  ensure file name uniqueness in the preserve directory.
-- 	  On Win32, it is also possible to end with "\\".  However, When a
-- 	  separating comma is following, you must use "//", since "\\" will
-- 	  include the comma in the file name. Therefore it is recommended to
-- 	  use '//', instead of '\\'.
-- 	- Spaces after the comma are ignored, other spaces are considered part
-- 	  of the directory name.  To have a space at the start of a directory
-- 	  name, precede it with a backslash.
-- 	- To include a comma in a directory name precede it with a backslash.
-- 	- A directory name may end in an ':' or '/'.
-- 	- Environment variables are expanded |:set_env|.
-- 	- Careful with '\' characters, type one before a space, type two to
-- 	  get one in the option (see |option-backslash|), for example: >

-- <	- For backwards compatibility with Vim version 3.0 a '>' at the start
-- 	  of the option is removed.
-- 	Using "." first in the list is recommended.  This means that editing
-- 	the same file twice will result in a warning.  Using "/tmp" on Unix is
-- 	discouraged: When the system crashes you lose the swap file.
-- 	"/var/tmp" is often not cleared when rebooting, thus is a better
-- 	choice than "/tmp".  But it can contain a lot of files, your swap
-- 	files get lost in the crowd.  That is why a "tmp" directory in your
-- 	home directory is tried first.
-- 	The use of |:set+=| and |:set-=| is preferred when adding or removing

-- 	- When set to one name, that format will be used whenever a new buffer
-- 	  is opened.  'fileformat' is set accordingly for that buffer.  The
-- 	  'fileformats' name will be used when a file is read into an existing
-- 	  buffer, no matter what 'fileformat' for that buffer is set to.
-- 	- When more than one name is present, separated by commas, automatic
-- 	  <EOL> detection will be done when reading a file.  When starting to
-- 	  edit a file, a check is done for the <EOL>:
-- 	  1. If all lines end in <CR><NL>, and 'fileformats' includes "dos",
-- 	     'fileformat' is set to "dos".
-- 	  2. If a <NL> is found and 'fileformats' includes "unix", 'fileformat'
-- 	     is set to "unix".  Note that when a <NL> is found without a
-- 	     preceding <CR>, "unix" is preferred over "dos".
-- 	  3. If 'fileformat' has not yet been set, and if a <CR> is found, and
-- 	     if 'fileformats' includes "mac", 'fileformat' is set to "mac".
-- 	     This means that "mac" is only chosen when:
-- 	      "unix" is not present or no <NL> is found in the file, and
-- 	      "dos" is not present or no <CR><NL> is found in the file.
-- 	     Except: if "unix" was chosen, but there is a <CR> before
-- 	     the first <NL>, and there appear to be more <CR>s than <NL>s in
-- 	     the first few lines, "mac" is used.
-- 	  4. If 'fileformat' is still not set, the first name from
-- 	     'fileformats' is used.
-- 	  When reading a file into an existing buffer, the same is done, but
-- 	  this happens like 'fileformat' has been set appropriately for that
-- 	  file only, the option is not changed.
-- 	When 'binary' is set, the value of 'fileformats' is not used.

-- Open a terminal window and run {cmd} in it.
--
-- 		{cmd} can be a string or a List, like with |job_start()|. The
-- 		string "NONE" can be used to open a terminal window without
-- 		starting a job, the pty of the terminal can be used by a
-- 		command like gdb.
--
-- 		Returns the buffer number of the terminal window.  If {cmd}
-- 		cannot be executed the window does open and shows an error
-- 		message.
-- 		If opening the window fails zero is returned.
--
-- 		{options} are similar to what is used for |job_start()|, see
-- 		|job-options|.  However, not all options can be used.  These
-- 		are supported:
-- 		   all timeout options
-- 		   "stoponexit", "cwd", "env"
-- 		   "callback", "out_cb", "err_cb", "exit_cb", "close_cb"
-- 		   "in_io", "in_top", "in_bot", "in_name", "in_buf"
-- 		   "out_io", "out_name", "out_buf", "out_modifiable", "out_msg"
-- 		   "err_io", "err_name", "err_buf", "err_modifiable", "err_msg"
-- 		However, at least one of stdin, stdout or stderr must be
-- 		connected to the terminal.  When I/O is connected to the
-- 		terminal then the callback function for that part is not used.
--
-- 		There are extra options:
-- 		   "term_name"	     name to use for the buffer name, instead
-- 				     of the command name.
-- 		   "term_rows"	     vertical size to use for the terminal,
-- 				     instead of using 'termwinsize'
-- 		   "term_cols"	     horizontal size to use for the terminal,
-- 				     instead of using 'termwinsize'
-- 		   "vertical"	     split the window vertically; note that
-- 				     other window position can be defined with
-- 				     command modifiers, such as |:belowright|.
-- 		   "curwin"	     use the current window, do not split the
-- 				     window; fails if the current buffer
-- 				     cannot be |abandon|ed
-- 		   "hidden"	     do not open a window
-- 		   "norestore"	     do not add the terminal window to a
-- 				     session file
-- 		   "term_kill"	     what to do when trying to close the
-- 				     terminal window, see |term_setkill()|
-- 		   "term_finish"     What to do when the job is finished:
-- 					"close": close any windows
-- 					"open": open window if needed
-- 				     Note that "open" can be interruptive.
-- 				     See |term++close| and |term++open|.
-- 		   "term_opencmd"    command to use for opening the window when
-- 				     "open" is used for "term_finish"; must
-- 				     have "%d" where the buffer number goes,
-- 				     e.g. "10split|buffer %d"; when not
-- 				     specified "botright sbuf %d" is used
-- 		   "eof_chars"	     Text to send after all buffer lines were
-- 				     written to the terminal.  When not set
-- 				     CTRL-D is used on MS-Windows. For Python
-- 				     use CTRL-Z or "exit()". For a shell use
-- 				     "exit".  A CR is always added.
-- 		   "ansi_colors"     A list of 16 color names or hex codes
-- 				     defining the ANSI palette used in GUI
-- 				     color modes.  See |g:terminal_ansi_colors|.
-- 		   "tty_type"	     (MS-Windows only): Specify which pty to
-- 				     use.  See 'termwintype' for the values.
-- 		   "term_api"	     function name prefix for the
-- 				     |terminal-api| function.  See
-- 				     |term_setapi()|.

-- 		Can also be used as a |method|: >
-- 			GetCommand()->term_start()
--- @return number
function vim.fn.term_start(cmd, options) end

-- Wait for pending updates of {buf} to be handled.
-- 		{buf} is used as with |term_getsize()|.
-- 		{time} is how long to wait for updates to arrive in msec.  If
-- 		not set then 10 msec will be used.

-- 		Note: Always returns the current screen column, thus if used
-- 		in a command (e.g. ":echo screencol()") it will return the
-- 		column inside the command line, which is 1 when the command is
-- 		executed. To get the cursor position in the file use one of
-- 		the following mappings: >

-- Remove a previously placed sign in one or more buffers.  This
-- 		is similar to the |:sign-unplace| command.
--
-- 		{group} is the sign group name. To use the global sign group,
-- 		use an empty string.  If {group} is set to '*', then all the
-- 		groups including the global group are used.
-- 		The signs in {group} are selected based on the entries in
-- 		{dict}.  The following optional entries in {dict} are
-- 		supported:
-- 			buffer	buffer name or number. See |bufname()|.
-- 			id	sign identifier
-- 		If {dict} is not supplied, then all the signs in {group} are
-- 		removed.
--
-- 		Returns 0 on success and -1 on failure.
--
-- 		Examples: >
-- 			" Remove sign 10 from buffer a.vim
-- 			call sign_unplace('', {'buffer' : "a.vim", 'id' : 10})
--
-- 			" Remove sign 20 in group 'g1' from buffer 3

-- Waits until {condition} evaluates to |TRUE|, where {condition}
-- 		is a |Funcref| or |string| containing an expression.
--
-- 		{timeout} is the maximum waiting time in milliseconds, -1
-- 		means forever.
--
-- 		Condition is evaluated on user events, internal events, and
-- 		every {interval} milliseconds (default: 200).
--
-- 		Returns a status integer:
-- 			0 if the condition was satisfied before timeout
-- 			-1 if the timeout was exceeded
-- 			-2 if the function was interrupted (by |CTRL-C|)
-- 			-3 if an error occurred
--- @return number
function vim.fn.wait(timeout, condition, interval) end

-- Overrides certain parts of Vim's internal processing to be able
-- 		to run tests. Only to be used for testing Vim!
-- 		The override is enabled when {val} is non-zero and removed
-- 		when {val} is zero.
-- 		Current supported values for name are:

-- 		redraw       disable the redrawing() function
-- 		redraw_flag  ignore the RedrawingDisabled flag
-- 		char_avail   disable the char_avail() function
-- 		starting     reset the "starting" variable, see below
-- 		nfa_fail     makes the NFA regexp engine fail to force a

-- 		no_query_mouse  do not query the mouse position for "dec"
-- 				terminals
-- 		no_wait_return	set the "no_wait_return" flag.  Not restored
-- 				with "ALL".
-- 		ALL	     clear all overrides ({val} is not used)
--
-- 		"starting" is to be used when a test should behave like
-- 		startup was done.  Since the tests are run by sourcing a
-- 		script the "starting" variable is non-zero. This is usually a
-- 		good thing (tests run faster), but sometimes changes behavior
-- 		in a way that the test doesn't work properly.
-- 		When using: >

--                    atomically, i.e. without interleaving redraws, RPC requests
--                    from other clients, or user interactions (however API
--                    methods may trigger autocommands or event processing which
--                    have such side-effects, e.g. |:sleep| may wake timers).
--                 2. To minimize RPC overhead (roundtrips) of a sequence of many
--                    requests.
--
--                 Parameters: ~

--
--                 Return: ~
--                     Array of two elements. The first is an array of return
--                     values. The second is NIL if all calls succeeded. If a
--                     call resulted in an error, it is a three-element array
--                     with the zero-based index of the call which resulted in an
--                     error, the error type and the error message. If an error

-- Return a string which contains characters indicating the
-- 		current state.  Mostly useful in callbacks that want to do
-- 		work that may not always be safe.  Roughly this works like:
-- 		- callback uses state() to check if work is safe to do.
-- 		  Yes: then do it right away.
-- 		  No:  add to work queue and add a |SafeState| and/or
-- 		       |SafeStateAgain| autocommand (|SafeState| triggers at
-- 		       toplevel, |SafeStateAgain| triggers after handling
-- 		       messages and callbacks).
-- 		- When SafeState or SafeStateAgain is triggered and executes
-- 		  your autocommand, check with `state()` if the work can be
-- 		  done now, and if yes remove it from the queue and execute.
-- 		  Remove the autocommand if the queue is now empty.
-- 		Also see |mode()|.
--
-- 		When {what} is given only characters in this string will be
-- 		added.  E.g, this checks if the screen has scrolled: >
-- 			if state('s') == ''
-- 			   " screen has not scrolled
-- <
-- 		These characters indicate the state, generally indicating that
-- 		something is busy:
-- 		    m	halfway a mapping, :normal command, feedkeys() or
-- 			stuffed command
-- 		    o	operator pending or waiting for a command argument,
-- 		        e.g. after |f|
-- 		    a	Insert mode autocomplete active
-- 		    x	executing an autocommand
-- 		    w	blocked on waiting, e.g. ch_evalexpr(), ch_read() and
-- 			ch_readraw() when reading json.
-- 		    S	not triggering SafeState or SafeStateAgain
-- 		    c	callback invoked, including timer (repeats for

-- Create or replace or add to the quickfix list.
--
-- 		When {what} is not present, use the items in {list}.  Each
-- 		item must be a dictionary.  Non-dictionary items in {list} are
-- 		ignored.  Each dictionary item can contain the following
-- 		entries:
--
-- 		    bufnr	buffer number; must be the number of a valid
-- 				buffer
-- 		    filename	name of a file; only used when "bufnr" is not
-- 				present or it is invalid.
-- 		    module	name of a module; if given it will be used in
-- 				quickfix error window instead of the filename
-- 		    lnum	line number in the file
-- 		    pattern	search pattern used to locate the error
-- 		    col		column number
-- 		    vcol	when non-zero: "col" is visual column
-- 				when zero: "col" is byte index
-- 		    nr		error number
-- 		    text	description of the error
-- 		    type	single-character error type, 'E', 'W', etc.
-- 		    valid	recognized error message
--
-- 		The "col", "vcol", "nr", "type" and "text" entries are
-- 		optional.  Either "lnum" or "pattern" entry can be used to
-- 		locate a matching error line.
-- 		If the "filename" and "bufnr" entries are not present or
-- 		neither the "lnum" or "pattern" entries are present, then the
-- 		item will not be handled as an error line.
-- 		If both "pattern" and "lnum" are present then "pattern" will
-- 		be used.
-- 		If the "valid" entry is not supplied, then the valid flag is
-- 		set when "bufnr" is a valid buffer or "filename" exists.
-- 		If you supply an empty {list}, the quickfix list will be
-- 		cleared.
-- 		Note that the list is not exactly the same as what
-- 		|getqflist()| returns.
--
-- 		{action} values:				*E927*
-- 		'a'	The items from {list} are added to the existing
-- 			quickfix list. If there is no existing list, then a
-- 			new list is created.
--
-- 		'r'	The items from the current quickfix list are replaced
-- 			with the items from {list}.  This can also be used to
-- 			clear the list: >
-- 				:call setqflist([], 'r')
-- <
-- 		'f'	All the quickfix lists in the quickfix stack are
-- 			freed.
--
-- 		If {action} is not present or is set to ' ', then a new list
-- 		is created. The new quickfix list is added after the current
-- 		quickfix list in the stack and all the following lists are
-- 		freed. To add a new quickfix list at the end of the stack,
-- 		set "nr" in {what} to "$".
--
-- 		If the optional {what} dictionary argument is supplied, then
-- 		only the items listed in {what} are set. The first {list}
-- 		argument is ignored.  The following items can be specified in
-- 		{what}:
-- 		    context	quickfix list context. See |quickfix-context|
-- 		    efm		errorformat to use when parsing text from
-- 				"lines". If this is not present, then the
-- 				'errorformat' option value is used.
-- 		    id		quickfix list identifier |quickfix-ID|
-- 		    items	list of quickfix entries. Same as the {list}
-- 				argument.
-- 		    lines	use 'errorformat' to parse a list of lines and
-- 				add the resulting entries to the quickfix list
-- 				{nr} or {id}.  Only a |List| value is supported.
-- 		    nr		list number in the quickfix stack; zero
-- 				means the current quickfix list and "$" means
-- 				the last quickfix list
-- 		    title	quickfix list title text
-- 		Unsupported keys in {what} are ignored.
-- 		If the "nr" item is not present, then the current quickfix list
-- 		is modified. When creating a new quickfix list, "nr" can be
-- 		set to a value one greater than the quickfix stack size.
-- 		When modifying a quickfix list, to guarantee that the correct
-- 		list is modified, "id" should be used instead of "nr" to
-- 		specify the list.
--
-- 		Examples (See also |setqflist-examples|): >
-- 		   :call setqflist([], 'r', {'title': 'My search'})
-- 		   :call setqflist([], 'r', {'nr': 2, 'title': 'Errors'})
-- 		   :call setqflist([], 'a', {'id':qfid, 'lines':["F1:10:L10"]})
-- <
-- 		Returns zero for success, -1 for failure.
--
-- 		This function can be used to create a quickfix list
-- 		independent of the 'errorformat' setting.  Use a command like
-- 		`:cc 1` to jump to the first position.

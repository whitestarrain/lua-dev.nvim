-- The result is a Number, which is 1 if there is a mapping that
-- 		contains {what} in somewhere in the rhs (what it is mapped to)
-- 		and this mapping exists in one of the modes indicated by
-- 		{mode}.
-- 		When {abbr} is there and it is |TRUE| use abbreviations
-- 		instead of mappings.  Don't forget to specify Insert and/or
-- 		Command-line mode.
-- 		Both the global mappings and the mappings local to the current
-- 		buffer are checked for a match.
-- 		If no matching mapping is found 0 is returned.
-- 		The following characters are recognized in {mode}:
-- 			n	Normal mode
-- 			v	Visual mode
-- 			o	Operator-pending mode
-- 			i	Insert mode
-- 			l	Language-Argument ("r", "f", "t", etc.)
-- 			c	Command-line mode
-- 		When {mode} is omitted, "nvo" is used.
--
-- 		This function is useful to check if a mapping already exists
-- 		to a function in a Vim script.  Example: >
-- 			:if !hasmapto('\ABCdoit')
-- 			:   map <Leader>d \ABCdoit
-- 			:endif
-- <		This installs the mapping to "\ABCdoit" only if there isn't
-- 		already a mapping to "\ABCdoit".
--- @return number

-- Check if there is a mapping that matches with {name} in mode
-- 		{mode}.  See |maparg()| for {mode} and special names in
-- 		{name}.
-- 		When {abbr} is there and it is non-zero use abbreviations
-- 		instead of mappings.
-- 		A match happens with a mapping that starts with {name} and
-- 		with a mapping which is equal to the start of {name}.
--
-- 			matches mapping "a"	"ab"	"abc" ~
-- 		   mapcheck("a")	yes	yes	 yes
-- 		   mapcheck("abc")	yes	yes	 yes
-- 		   mapcheck("ax")	yes	no	 no
-- 		   mapcheck("b")	no	no	 no
--
-- 		The difference with maparg() is that mapcheck() finds a
-- 		mapping that matches with {name}, while maparg() only finds a
-- 		mapping for {name} exactly.
-- 		When there is no mapping that starts with {name}, an empty
-- 		String is returned.  If there is one, the RHS of that mapping
-- 		is returned.  If there are several mappings that start with
-- 		{name}, the RHS of one of them is returned.  This will be
-- 		"<Nop>" if the RHS is empty.
-- 		The mappings local to the current buffer are checked first,
-- 		then the global mappings.
-- 		This function can be used to check if a mapping can be added
-- 		without being ambiguous.  Example: >
-- 	:if mapcheck("_vv") == ""
-- 	:   map _vv :set guifont=7x13<CR>
-- 	:endif
-- <		This avoids adding the "_vv" mapping when there already is a

-- 		    "id"	    the timer ID
-- 		    "time"	    time the timer was started with

-- Same as |matchadd()|, but requires a list of positions {pos}
-- 		instead of a pattern. This command is faster than |matchadd()|
-- 		because it does not require to handle regular expressions and

-- 		to be used when fast match additions and deletions are
-- 		required, for example to highlight matching parentheses.
-- 							*E5030* *E5031*
-- 		The list {pos} can contain one of these items:
-- 		- A number.  This whole line will be highlighted.  The first
-- 		  line has number 1.
-- 		- A list with one number, e.g., [23]. The whole line with this
-- 		  number will be highlighted.
-- 		- A list with two numbers, e.g., [23, 11]. The first number is
-- 		  the line number, the second one is the column number (first
-- 		  column is 1, the value must correspond to the byte index as
-- 		  |col()| would return).  The character at this position will
-- 		  be highlighted.
-- 		- A list with three numbers, e.g., [23, 11, 3]. As above, but

--
-- 		If the expansion fails, the result is an empty string.  A name
-- 		for a non-existing file is not included, unless {expr} does
-- 		not start with '%', '#' or '<', see below.
--
-- 		When {expr} starts with '%', '#' or '<', the expansion is done
-- 		like for the |cmdline-special| variables with their associated
-- 		modifiers.  Here is a short overview:
--
-- 			%		current file name
-- 			#		alternate file name
-- 			#n		alternate file name n
-- 			<cfile>		file name under the cursor
-- 			<afile>		autocmd file name
-- 			<abuf>		autocmd buffer number (as a String!)
-- 			<amatch>	autocmd matched name
-- 			<sfile>		sourced script file or function name
-- 			<slnum>		sourced script line number or function
-- 					line number
-- 			<sflnum>	script file line number, also when in
-- 					a function
-- 			<cword>		word under the cursor
-- 			<cWORD>		WORD under the cursor
-- 			<client>	the {clientid} of the last received
-- 					message |server2client()|
-- 		Modifiers:
-- 			:p		expand to full path
-- 			:h		head (last path component removed)
-- 			:t		tail (last path component only)
-- 			:r		root (one extension removed)
-- 			:e		extension only
--
-- 		Example: >
-- 			:let &tags = expand("%:p:h") . "/tags"
-- <		Note that when expanding a string that starts with '%', '#' or
-- 		'<', any following text is ignored.  This does NOT work: >
-- 			:let doesntwork = expand("%:h.bak")
-- <		Use this: >
-- 			:let doeswork = expand("%:h") . ".bak"
-- <		Also note that expanding "<cfile>" and others only returns the
-- 		referenced file name without further expansion.  If "<cfile>"
-- 		is "~/.cshrc", you need to do another expand() to have the
-- 		"~/" expanded into the path of the home directory: >
-- 			:echo expand(expand("<cfile>"))
-- <
-- 		There cannot be white space between the variables and the
-- 		following modifier.  The |fnamemodify()| function can be used
-- 		to modify normal file names.
--
-- 		When using '%' or '#', and the current or alternate file name
-- 		is not defined, an empty string is used.  Using "%:p" in a
-- 		buffer with no name, results in the current directory, with a
-- 		'/' added.
--
-- 		When {expr} does not start with '%', '#' or '<', it is
-- 		expanded like a file name is expanded on the command line.
-- 		'suffixes' and 'wildignore' are used, unless the optional
-- 		{nosuf} argument is given and it is |TRUE|.
-- 		Names for non-existing files are included.  The "**" item can
-- 		be used to search in a directory tree.  For example, to find
-- 		all "README" files in the current directory and below: >
-- 			:echo expand("**/README")
-- <
-- 		expand() can also be used to expand variables and environment
-- 		variables that are only known in a shell.  But this can be
-- 		slow, because a shell may be used to do the expansion.  See
-- 		|expr-env-expand|.
-- 		The expanded variable is still handled like a list of file
-- 		names.  When an environment variable cannot be expanded, it is
-- 		left unchanged.  Thus ":echo expand('$FOOBAR')" results in
-- 		"$FOOBAR".
--
-- 		See |glob()| for finding existing files.  See |system()| for
-- 		getting the raw output of an external command.
--- @param list any[]

-- 		  "rhs"	     The {rhs} of the mapping as typed.
-- 		  "silent"   1 for a |:map-silent| mapping, else 0.
-- 		  "noremap"  1 if the {rhs} of the mapping is not remappable.
-- 		  "expr"     1 for an expression mapping (|:map-<expr>|).
-- 		  "buffer"   1 for a buffer local mapping (|:map-local|).
-- 		  "mode"     Modes for which the mapping is defined. In
-- 			     addition to the modes mentioned above, these
-- 			     characters will be used:
-- 			     " "     Normal, Visual and Operator-pending
-- 			     "!"     Insert and Commandline mode
-- 				     (|mapmode-ic|)
-- 		  "sid"	     The script local ID, used for <sid> mappings

-- Returns a list of tags matching the regular expression {expr}.
--
-- 		If {filename} is passed it is used to prioritize the results

--
-- 		Each list item is a dictionary with at least the following

-- 					current directory or a full path.
-- 			cmd		Ex command used to locate the tag in
-- 					the file.
-- 			kind		Type of the tag.  The value for this
-- 					entry depends on the language specific
-- 					kind values.  Only available when
-- 					using a tags file generated by
-- 					Exuberant ctags or hdrtag.
-- 			static		A file specific tag.  Refer to
-- 					|static-tag| for more information.
-- 		More entries may be present, depending on the content of the
-- 		tags file: access, implementation, inherits and signature.
-- 		Refer to the ctags documentation for information about these
-- 		fields.  For C code the fields "struct", "class" and "enum"
-- 		may appear, they give the name of the entity the tag is
-- 		contained in.
--
-- 		The ex-command "cmd" can be either an ex search pattern, a
-- 		line number or a line number followed by a byte number.
--
-- 		If there are no matching tags, then an empty list is returned.
--

-- 		busy or Vim is not waiting for input the time will be longer.
--
-- 		{callback} is the function to call.  It can be the name of a

-- 		is the timer ID.  The callback is only invoked when Vim is
-- 		waiting for input.
--

-- 		   "repeat"	Number of times to repeat the callback.
-- 				-1 means forever.  Default is 1.
-- 				If the timer causes an error three times in a
-- 				row the repeat is cancelled.
--
-- 		Example: >
-- 			func MyHandler(timer)
-- 			  echo 'Handler called'

-- 		{startcol} is the byte offset in the line where the completed
-- 		text start.  The text up to the cursor is the original text
-- 		that will be replaced by the matches.  Use col('.') for an
-- 		empty string.  "col('.') - 1" will replace one character by a
-- 		match.
-- 		{matches} must be a |List|.  Each |List| item is one match.
-- 		See |complete-items| for the kind of items that are possible.
-- 		Note that the after calling this function you need to avoid
-- 		inserting anything that would cause completion to stop.
-- 		The match can be selected with CTRL-N and CTRL-P as usual with
-- 		Insert mode completion.  The popup menu will appear if

-- Connect a socket to an address. If {mode} is "pipe" then
-- 		{address} should be the path of a named pipe. If {mode} is
-- 		"tcp" then {address} should be of the form "host:port" where
-- 		the host should be an ip adderess or host name, and port the
-- 		port number.
--
-- 		Returns a |channel| ID. Close the socket with |chanclose()|.
-- 		Use |chansend()| to send data over a bytes socket, and
-- 		|rpcrequest()| and |rpcnotify()| to communicate with a RPC
-- 		socket.
--
-- 		{opts} is a dictionary with these keys:
-- 		  |on_data| : callback invoked when data was read from socket
-- 		  data_buffered : read socket data in |channel-buffered| mode.
-- 		  rpc     : If set, |msgpack-rpc| will be used to communicate
-- 			    over the socket.
-- 		Returns:
-- 		  - The channel ID on success (greater than zero)
-- 		  - 0 on invalid arguments or connection failure.
--- @return number
function vim.fn.sockconnect(mode, address, opts) end

-- Restore typeahead that was saved with a previous |inputsave()|.
-- 		Should be called the same number of times inputsave() is
-- 		called.  Calling it more often is harmless though.
-- 		Returns 1 when there is nothing to restore, 0 otherwise.
--- @return number
function vim.fn.inputrestore() end

-- Get the Job associated with terminal window {buf}.
-- 		{buf} is used as with |term_getsize()|.
-- 		Returns |v:null| when there is no job.
--
-- 		Can also be used as a |method|: >
-- 			GetBufnr()->term_getjob()
--- @return job
function vim.fn.term_getjob(buf) end

-- The result is a List of Numbers.  The first number is the same
-- 		as what |screenchar()| returns.  Further numbers are
-- 		composing characters on top of the base character.
-- 		This is mainly to be used for testing.
-- 		Returns an empty List when row or col is out of range.
--
-- 		Can also be used as a |method|: >
-- 			GetRow()->screenchars(col)
--- @return list
function vim.fn.screenchars(row, col) end

-- Sends a request to {channel} to invoke {method} via
-- 		|RPC| and blocks until a response is received.

-- 			:let result = rpcrequest(rpc_chan, "func", 1, 2, 3)
--- @return sends
function vim.fn.rpcrequest(channel, method, ...) end

-- On MS-Windows, when {filename} is a shortcut (a .lnk file),
-- 		returns the path the shortcut points to in a simplified form.
-- 		On Unix, repeat resolving symbolic links in all path
-- 		components of {filename} and return the simplified result.
-- 		To cope with link cycles, resolving of symbolic links is
-- 		stopped after 100 iterations.
-- 		On other systems, return the simplified {filename}.
-- 		The simplification step is done as by |simplify()|.
-- 		resolve() keeps a leading path component specifying the
-- 		current directory (provided the result is still a relative
-- 		path name) and also keeps a trailing path separator.
--- @return string
function vim.fn.resolve(filename) end

-- The result is a Number, which is the height of window {nr}.
-- 		{nr} can be the window number or the |window-ID|.
-- 		When {nr} is zero, the height of the current window is
-- 		returned.  When window {nr} doesn't exist, -1 is returned.
-- 		An existing window always has a height of zero or more.
-- 		This excludes any window toolbar line.
-- 		Examples: >
--   :echo "The current window has " . winheight(0) . " lines."
--- @return number
function vim.fn.winheight(nr) end

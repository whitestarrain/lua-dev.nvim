-- 		This works like the ":substitute" command (without any flags).
-- 		But the matching with {pat} is always done like the 'magic'

-- 		portable).  'ignorecase' is still relevant, use |/\c| or |/\C|
-- 		if you want to ignore or match case and ignore 'ignorecase'.
-- 		'smartcase' is not used.  See |string-match| for how {pat} is
-- 		used.
--
-- 		A "~" in {sub} is not replaced with the previous {sub}.
-- 		Note that some codes in {sub} have a special meaning
-- 		|sub-replace-special|.  For example, to replace something with
-- 		"\n" (two characters), use "\\\\n" or '\\n'.
--
-- 		When {pat} does not match in {expr}, {expr} is returned

--
-- 		Example: >

-- <		This removes the last component of the 'path' option. >

-- 		also a String when a modifier (shift, control, alt) was used
-- 		that is not included in the character.
--
-- 		When [expr] is 0 and Esc is typed, there will be a short delay
-- 		while Vim waits to see if this is the start of an escape
-- 		sequence.
--
-- 		When [expr] is 1 only the first byte is returned.  For a
-- 		one-byte character it is the character itself as a number.
-- 		Use nr2char() to convert it to a String.
--
-- 		Use getcharmod() to obtain any additional modifiers.
--
-- 		When the user clicks a mouse button, the mouse event will be
-- 		returned.  The position can then be found in |v:mouse_col|,
-- 		|v:mouse_lnum|, |v:mouse_winid| and |v:mouse_win|.  This
-- 		example positions the mouse as it would normally happen: >
-- 			let c = getchar()
-- 			if c == "\<LeftMouse>" && v:mouse_win > 0
-- 			  exe v:mouse_win . "wincmd w"
-- 			  exe v:mouse_lnum
-- 			  exe "normal " . v:mouse_col . "|"

-- <
-- 		There is no prompt, you will somehow have to make clear to the

-- 		There is no mapping for the character.
-- 		Key codes are replaced, thus when the user presses the <Del>
-- 		key you get the code for the <Del> key, not the raw character
-- 		sequence.  Examples: >
-- 			getchar() == "\<Del>"
-- 			getchar() == "\<S-Left>"

-- Characters in {string} are queued for processing as if they

--
-- 		By default the string is added to the end of the typeahead
-- 		buffer, thus if a mapping is still being executed the
-- 		characters come after them.  Use the 'i' flag to insert before
-- 		other characters, they will be executed next, before any
-- 		characters from a mapping.
--
-- 		The function does not wait for processing of keys contained in
-- 		{string}.
--
-- 		To include special keys into {string}, use double-quotes
-- 		and "\..." notation |expr-quote|. For example,
-- 		feedkeys("\<CR>") simulates pressing of the <Enter> key. But
-- 		feedkeys('\<CR>') pushes 5 characters.
-- 		The |<Ignore>| keycode may be used to exit the
-- 		wait-for-character without doing anything.
--
-- 		{mode} is a String, which can contain these character flags:
-- 		'm'	Remap keys. This is default.  If {mode} is absent,
-- 			keys are remapped.
-- 		'n'	Do not remap keys.
-- 		't'	Handle keys as if typed; otherwise they are handled as
-- 			if coming from a mapping.  This matters for undo,
-- 			opening folds, etc.
-- 		'i'	Insert the string instead of appending (see above).
-- 		'x'	Execute commands until typeahead is empty.  This is
-- 			similar to using ":normal!".  You can call feedkeys()
-- 			several times without 'x' and then one time with 'x'
-- 			(possibly with an empty {string}) to execute all the
-- 			typeahead.  Note that when Vim ends in Insert mode it
-- 			will behave as if <Esc> is typed, to avoid getting
-- 			stuck, waiting for a character to be typed before the
-- 			script continues.
-- 			Note that if you manage to call feedkeys() while
-- 			executing commands, thus calling it recursively, the
-- 			all typehead will be consumed by the last call.
-- 		'!'	When used with 'x' will not end Insert mode. Can be
-- 			used in a test when a timer is set to exit Insert mode
-- 			a little later.  Useful for testing CursorHoldI.
--
-- 		Return value is always 0.

--
-- 		The {name} can be a String or a Number.  The optional {dict}

-- 				|hl-CursorLineNr|.
--
-- 		If the sign named {name} already exists, then the attributes
-- 		of the sign are updated.

--
-- 		These colors are used in the GUI and in the terminal when

-- 		with all matching files. The advantage of using a List is,
-- 		you also get filenames containing newlines correctly.
-- 		Otherwise the result is a String and when there are several
-- 		matches, they are separated by <NL> characters.
--
-- 		If the expansion fails, the result is an empty String or List.
--
-- 		You can also use |readdir()| if you need to do complicated
-- 		things, such as limiting the number of matches.
--
-- 		A name for a non-existing file is not included.  A symbolic
-- 		link is only included if it points to an existing file.
-- 		However, when the {alllinks} argument is present and it is
-- 		|TRUE| then all symbolic links are included.
--
-- 		For most systems backticks can be used to get files names from
-- 		any external command.  Example: >
-- 			:let tagfiles = glob("`find . -name tags -print`")
-- 			:let &tags = substitute(tagfiles, "\n", ",", "g")
-- <		The result of the program inside the backticks should be one
-- 		item per line.  Spaces inside an item are allowed.
--
-- 		See |expand()| for expanding special Vim variables.  See
-- 		|system()| for getting the raw output of an external command.

-- {feature} argument is a feature name like "nvim-0.2.1" or
-- 		"win32", see below.  See also |exists()|.
--
-- 		Vim's compile-time feature-names (prefixed with "+") are not
-- 		recognized because Nvim is always compiled with all possible
-- 		features. |feature-compile|
--
-- 		Feature names can be:
-- 		1.  Nvim version. For example the "nvim-0.2.1" feature means
-- 		    that Nvim is version 0.2.1 or later: >
-- 			:if has("nvim-0.2.1")
--
-- <		2.  Runtime condition or other pseudo-feature. For example the
-- 		    "win32" feature checks if the current system is Windows: >
-- 			:if has("win32")
-- <							*feature-list*
-- 		    List of supported pseudo-feature names:
-- 		        acl		|ACL| support
-- 			bsd		BSD system (not macOS, use "mac" for that).
-- 		        iconv		Can use |iconv()| for conversion.
-- 		        +shellslash	Can use backslashes in filenames (Windows)
-- 			clipboard	|clipboard| provider is available.
-- 			mac		MacOS system.
-- 			nvim		This is Nvim.
-- 			python2		Legacy Vim |python2| interface. |has-python|
-- 			python3		Legacy Vim |python3| interface. |has-python|
-- 			pythonx		Legacy Vim |python_x| interface. |has-pythonx|
-- 			ttyin		input is a terminal (tty)
-- 			ttyout		output is a terminal (tty)
-- 			unix		Unix system.
-- 			*vim_starting*	True during |startup|.
-- 			win32		Windows system (32 or 64 bit).
-- 			win64		Windows system (64 bit).
-- 			wsl		WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) system
--
-- 							*has-patch*
-- 		3.  Vim patch. For example the "patch123" feature means that
-- 		    Vim patch 123 at the current |v:version| was included: >
-- 			:if v:version > 602 || v:version == 602 && has("patch148")
--
-- <		4.  Vim version. For example the "patch-7.4.237" feature means
-- 		    that Nvim is Vim-compatible to version 7.4.237 or later. >
-- 			:if has("patch-7.4.237")

-- Return the reference count of {expr}.  When {expr} is of a
-- 		type that does not have a reference count, returns -1.  Only

--
-- 		Can also be used as a |method|: >
-- 			GetVarname()->test_refcount()
--- @return number
function vim.fn.test_refcount(expr) end

-- Return the number of lines that scrolled to above the top of
-- 		terminal {buf}.  This is the offset between the row number
-- 		used for |term_getline()| and |getline()|, so that: >
-- 			term_getline(buf, N)
-- <		is equal to: >
-- 			getline(N + term_getscrolled(buf))
-- <		(if that line exists).
--
-- 		{buf} is used as with |term_getsize()|.
--
-- 		Can also be used as a |method|: >
-- 			GetBufnr()->term_getscrolled()
--- @return number
function vim.fn.term_getscrolled(buf) end

-- Return the current command-line.  Only works when the command
-- 		line is being edited, thus requires use of |c_CTRL-\_e| or
-- 		|c_CTRL-R_=|.
-- 		Example: >
-- 			:cmap <F7> <C-\>eescape(getcmdline(), ' \')<CR>
-- <		Also see |getcmdtype()|, |getcmdpos()| and |setcmdpos()|.
-- 		Returns an empty string when entering a password or using
-- 		|inputsecret()|.
--- @return string
function vim.fn.getcmdline() end

-- The result is a Number, which is |TRUE| if a buffer called
-- 		{expr} exists.
-- 		If the {expr} argument is a number, buffer numbers are used.
-- 		Number zero is the alternate buffer for the current window.
--
-- 		If the {expr} argument is a string it must match a buffer name
-- 		exactly.  The name can be:
-- 		- Relative to the current directory.
-- 		- A full path.
-- 		- The name of a buffer with 'buftype' set to "nofile".
-- 		- A URL name.
-- 		Unlisted buffers will be found.
-- 		Note that help files are listed by their short name in the
-- 		output of |:buffers|, but bufexists() requires using their
-- 		long name to be able to find them.
-- 		bufexists() may report a buffer exists, but to use the name
-- 		with a |:buffer| command you may need to use |expand()|.  Esp
-- 		for MS-Windows 8.3 names in the form "c:\DOCUME~1"
-- 		Use "bufexists(0)" to test for the existence of an alternate
-- 		file name.

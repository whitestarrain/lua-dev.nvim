-- 		Returns the buffer number or zero when the diff fails.
-- 		Also see |terminal-diff|.
-- 		NOTE: this does not work with double-width characters yet.
--
-- 		The top part of the buffer contains the contents of the first
-- 		file, the bottom part of the buffer contains the contents of
-- 		the second file.  The middle part shows the differences.
-- 		The parts are separated by a line of equals.
--
-- 		If the {options} argument is present, it must be a Dict with
-- 		these possible members:
-- 		   "term_name"	     name to use for the buffer name, instead
-- 				     of the first file name.
-- 		   "term_rows"	     vertical size to use for the terminal,
-- 				     instead of using 'termwinsize'
-- 		   "term_cols"	     horizontal size to use for the terminal,
-- 				     instead of using 'termwinsize'
-- 		   "vertical"	     split the window vertically
-- 		   "curwin"	     use the current window, do not split the
-- 				     window; fails if the current buffer
-- 				     cannot be |abandon|ed
-- 		   "bufnr"	     do not create a new buffer, use the
-- 				     existing buffer "bufnr".  This buffer
-- 				     must have been previously created with
-- 				     term_dumpdiff() or term_dumpload() and
-- 				     visible in a window.
-- 		   "norestore"	     do not add the terminal window to a
-- 				     session file
--
-- 		Each character in the middle part indicates a difference. If
-- 		there are multiple differences only the first in this list is
-- 		used:
-- 			X	different character
-- 			w	different width
-- 			f	different foreground color
-- 			b	different background color
-- 			a	different attribute
-- 			+	missing position in first file
-- 			-	missing position in second file

-- Defines a pattern to be highlighted in the current window (a
-- 		"match").  It will be highlighted with {group}.  Returns an
-- 		identification number (ID), which can be used to delete the
-- 		match using |matchdelete()|.
-- 		Matching is case sensitive and magic, unless case sensitivity
-- 		or magicness are explicitly overridden in {pattern}.  The
-- 		'magic', 'smartcase' and 'ignorecase' options are not used.
-- 		The "Conceal" value is special, it causes the match to be
-- 		concealed.
--
-- 		The optional {priority} argument assigns a priority to the
-- 		match.  A match with a high priority will have its
-- 		highlighting overrule that of a match with a lower priority.
-- 		A priority is specified as an integer (negative numbers are no
-- 		exception).  If the {priority} argument is not specified, the
-- 		default priority is 10.  The priority of 'hlsearch' is zero,
-- 		hence all matches with a priority greater than zero will
-- 		overrule it.  Syntax highlighting (see 'syntax') is a separate
-- 		mechanism, and regardless of the chosen priority a match will
-- 		always overrule syntax highlighting.
--
-- 		The optional {id} argument allows the request for a specific
-- 		match ID.  If a specified ID is already taken, an error
-- 		message will appear and the match will not be added.  An ID
-- 		is specified as a positive integer (zero excluded).  IDs 1, 2
-- 		and 3 are reserved for |:match|, |:2match| and |:3match|,
-- 		respectively.  If the {id} argument is not specified or -1,
-- 		|matchadd()| automatically chooses a free ID.
--
-- 		The optional {dict} argument allows for further custom
-- 		values. Currently this is used to specify a match specific
-- 		conceal character that will be shown for |hl-Conceal|
-- 		highlighted matches. The dict can have the following members:
--
-- 			conceal	    Special character to show instead of the
-- 				    match (only for |hl-Conceal| highlighed
-- 				    matches, see |:syn-cchar|)
-- 			window	    Instead of the current window use the
-- 				    window with this number or window ID.
--
-- 		The number of matches is not limited, as it is the case with
-- 		the |:match| commands.
--
-- 		Example: >
-- 			:highlight MyGroup ctermbg=green guibg=green
-- 			:let m = matchadd("MyGroup", "TODO")
-- <		Deletion of the pattern: >
-- 			:call matchdelete(m)
--
-- <		A list of matches defined by |matchadd()| and |:match| are
-- 		available from |getmatches()|.  All matches can be deleted in
-- 		one operation by |clearmatches()|.
--- @return number
function vim.fn.matchadd(group, pattern, priority, id) end

-- Like |append()| but append the text in buffer {expr}.
--
-- 		For the use of {expr}, see |bufname()|.
--
-- 		{lnum} is used like with |append()|.  Note that using |line()|
-- 		would use the current buffer, not the one appending to.
-- 		Use "$" to append at the end of the buffer.
--
-- 		On success 0 is returned, on failure 1 is returned.
--
-- 		If {expr} is not a valid buffer or {lnum} is not valid, an
-- 		error message is given. Example: >

-- The result is a String, which is a formatted date and time, as

-- 		See the manual page of the C function strftime() for the
-- 		format.  The maximum length of the result is 80 characters.

-- 		one of the patterns in 'wildignore' will be skipped and
-- 		'suffixes' affect the ordering of matches.
-- 		'wildignorecase' always applies.
--
-- 		When {list} is present and it is |TRUE| the result is a List
-- 		with all matching files. The advantage of using a List is,
-- 		you also get filenames containing newlines correctly.
-- 		Otherwise the result is a String and when there are several
-- 		matches, they are separated by <NL> characters.
--
-- 		If the expansion fails, the result is an empty String or List.
--
-- 		You can also use |readdir()| if you need to do complicated
-- 		things, such as limiting the number of matches.
--
-- 		A name for a non-existing file is not included.  A symbolic
-- 		link is only included if it points to an existing file.
-- 		However, when the {alllinks} argument is present and it is
-- 		|TRUE| then all symbolic links are included.
--
-- 		For most systems backticks can be used to get files names from
-- 		any external command.  Example: >
-- 			:let tagfiles = glob("`find . -name tags -print`")
-- 			:let &tags = substitute(tagfiles, "\n", ",", "g")
-- <		The result of the program inside the backticks should be one

--
-- 		When {func} is a |Funcref| or a function name, this function

-- 		channel is complete, it may only return the first part and you
-- 		need to use |ch_readraw()| to fetch the rest.
-- 		See |channel-use|.
--
-- 		Can also be used as a |method|: >
-- 			GetChannel()->ch_evalraw(rawstring)
function vim.fn.ch_evalraw(handle, string, options) end

-- Get the buffer number that {handle} is using for {what}.
-- 		{handle} can be a Channel or a Job that has a Channel.
-- 		{what} can be "err" for stderr, "out" for stdout or empty for
-- 		socket output.
-- 		Returns -1 when there is no buffer.
--
-- 		Can also be used as a |method|: >
-- 			GetChannel()->ch_getbufnr(what)
--- @return number
function vim.fn.ch_getbufnr(handle, what) end

-- Returns a list with all property type names.
--
-- 		{props} can contain a "bufnr" item.  When it is given, use
-- 		this buffer instead of the global property types.
--
-- 		See |text-properties| for information about text properties.
--- @return list
function vim.fn.prop_type_list(props) end

-- Get the Job associated with {channel}.
-- 		If there is no job calling |job_status()| on the returned Job
-- 		will result in "fail".
--
-- 		Can also be used as a |method|: >
-- 			GetChannel()->ch_getjob()
--- @return job
function vim.fn.ch_getjob(channel) end

-- When {expr} is a String or a Number the length in bytes is
-- 		used, as with |strlen()|.
-- 		When {expr} is a |List| the number of items in the |List| is
-- 		returned.
-- 		When {expr} is a |Blob| the number of bytes is returned.
-- 		When {expr} is a |Dictionary| the number of entries in the
-- 		|Dictionary| is returned.
-- 		Otherwise an error is given.
--- @return number
function vim.fn.len(expr) end

-- Get the value of window-local variable {varname} in window
-- 		{winnr} in tab page {tabnr}.
-- 		When {varname} is empty a dictionary with all window-local
-- 		variables is returned.
-- 		When {varname} is equal to "&" get the values of all
-- 		window-local options in a Dictionary.
-- 		Otherwise, when {varname} starts with "&" get the value of a
-- 		window-local option.
-- 		Note that {varname} must be the name without "w:".
-- 		Tabs are numbered starting with one.  For the current tabpage
-- 		use |getwinvar()|.
-- 		{winnr} can be the window number or the |window-ID|.
-- 		When {winnr} is zero the current window is used.
-- 		This also works for a global option, buffer-local option and
-- 		window-local option, but it doesn't work for a global variable
-- 		or buffer-local variable.
-- 		When the tab, window or variable doesn't exist {def} or an
-- 		empty string is returned, there is no error message.
-- 		Examples: >
-- 			:let list_is_on = gettabwinvar(1, 2, '&list')
-- 			:echo "myvar = " . gettabwinvar(3, 1, 'myvar')
-- <
-- 		To obtain all window-local variables use: >
-- 			gettabwinvar({tabnr}, {winnr}, '&')
function vim.fn.gettabwinvar(tabnr, winnr, name, def) end

-- Returns a Dictionary with information about {handle}.  The
-- 		items are:
-- 		   "id"		  number of the channel
-- 		   "status"	  "open", "buffered" or "closed", like
-- 				  ch_status()
-- 		When opened with ch_open():
-- 		   "hostname"	  the hostname of the address
-- 		   "port"	  the port of the address
-- 		   "sock_status"  "open" or "closed"
-- 		   "sock_mode"	  "NL", "RAW", "JSON" or "JS"
-- 		   "sock_io"	  "socket"
-- 		   "sock_timeout" timeout in msec
-- 		When opened with job_start():
-- 		   "out_status"	  "open", "buffered" or "closed"
-- 		   "out_mode"	  "NL", "RAW", "JSON" or "JS"
-- 		   "out_io"	  "null", "pipe", "file" or "buffer"
-- 		   "out_timeout"  timeout in msec
-- 		   "err_status"	  "open", "buffered" or "closed"
-- 		   "err_mode"	  "NL", "RAW", "JSON" or "JS"
-- 		   "err_io"	  "out", "null", "pipe", "file" or "buffer"
-- 		   "err_timeout"  timeout in msec
-- 		   "in_status"	  "open" or "closed"
-- 		   "in_mode"	  "NL", "RAW", "JSON" or "JS"
-- 		   "in_io"	  "null", "pipe", "file" or "buffer"
-- 		   "in_timeout"	  timeout in msec
--
-- 		Can also be used as a |method|: >
-- 			GetChannel()->ch_info()
--- @return string
function vim.fn.ch_info(handle) end

-- Set the matches for Insert mode completion.
-- 		Can only be used in Insert mode.  You need to use a mapping
-- 		with CTRL-R = (see |i_CTRL-R|).  It does not work after CTRL-O
-- 		or with an expression mapping.
-- 		{startcol} is the byte offset in the line where the completed
-- 		text start.  The text up to the cursor is the original text
-- 		that will be replaced by the matches.  Use col('.') for an
-- 		empty string.  "col('.') - 1" will replace one character by a
-- 		match.
-- 		{matches} must be a |List|.  Each |List| item is one match.
-- 		See |complete-items| for the kind of items that are possible.
-- 		Note that the after calling this function you need to avoid
-- 		inserting anything that would cause completion to stop.
-- 		The match can be selected with CTRL-N and CTRL-P as usual with
-- 		Insert mode completion.  The popup menu will appear if
-- 		specified, see |ins-completion-menu|.
-- 		Example: >
-- 	inoremap <F5> <C-R>=ListMonths()<CR>
--
-- 	func! ListMonths()
-- 	  call complete(col('.'), ['January', 'February', 'March',
-- 		\ 'April', 'May', 'June', 'July', 'August', 'September',
-- 		\ 'October', 'November', 'December'])
-- 	  return ''
-- 	endfunc
-- <		This isn't very useful, but it shows how it works.  Note that
-- 		an empty string is returned to avoid a zero being inserted.
--- @return none
function vim.fn.complete(startcol, matches) end

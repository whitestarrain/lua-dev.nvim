---                 covering the EOL of a line, continue the

---               • virt_text_pos : position of virtual text.
---                 Possible values:
---                 • "eol": right after eol character (default)
---                 • "overlay": display over the specified
---                   column, without shifting the underlying
---                   text.
---                 • "right_align": display right aligned in the
---                   window.
---
---               • virt_text_win_col : position the virtual text
---                 at a fixed window column (starting from the
---                 first text column)
---               • virt_text_hide : hide the virtual text when
---                 the background text is selected or hidden due
---                 to horizontal scroll 'nowrap'
---               • hl_mode : control how highlights are combined
---                 with the highlights of the text. Currently
---                 only affects virt_text highlights, but might
---                 affect `hl_group` in later versions.
---                 • "replace": only show the virt_text color.
---                   This is the default
---                 • "combine": combine with background text
---                   color
---                 • "blend": blend with background text color.
---
---               • virt_lines : virtual lines to add next to this
---                 mark This should be an array over lines, where
---                 each line in turn is an array over [text,
---                 highlight] tuples. In general, buffer and
---                 window options do not affect the display of
---                 the text. In particular 'wrap' and 'linebreak'
---                 options do not take effect, so the number of
---                 extra screen lines will always match the size
---                 of the array. However the 'tabstop' buffer
---                 option is still used for hard tabs. By default
---                 lines are placed below the buffer line
---                 containing the mark.
---               • virt_lines_above: place virtual lines above
---                 instead.
---               • virt_lines_leftcol: Place extmarks in the
---                 leftmost column of the window, bypassing sign
---                 and number columns.
---               • ephemeral : for use with
---                 |nvim_set_decoration_provider| callbacks. The
---                 mark will only be used for the current redraw
---                 cycle, and not be permantently stored in the
---                 buffer.
---               • right_gravity : boolean that indicates the
---                 direction the extmark will be shifted in when
---                 new text is inserted (true for right, false
---                 for left). defaults to true.
---               • end_right_gravity : boolean that indicates the
---                 direction the extmark end position (if it
---                 exists) will be shifted in when new text is
---                 inserted (true for right, false for left).
---                 Defaults to false.
---               • priority: a priority value for the highlight
---                 group. For example treesitter highlighting
---                 uses a value of 100.
---               • strict: boolean that indicates extmark should
---                 not be placed if the line or column value is
---                 past the end of the buffer or end of the line
---                 respectively. Defaults to true.
---               • sign_text: string of length 1-2 used to
---                 display in the sign column. Note: ranges are
---                 unsupported and decorations are only applied
---                 to start_row
---               • sign_hl_group: name of the highlight group
---                 used to highlight the sign column text. Note:
---                 ranges are unsupported and decorations are
---                 only applied to start_row
---               • number_hl_group: name of the highlight group

---                 relative to:
---                 • "editor" The global editor grid
---                 • "win" Window given by the `win` field, or
---                   current window.
---                 • "cursor" Cursor position in current window.
---
---               • win: |window-ID| for relative="win".
---               • anchor: Decides which corner of the float to
---                 place at (row,col):
---                 • "NW" northwest (default)
---                 • "NE" northeast
---                 • "SW" southwest
---                 • "SE" southeast
---
---               • width: Window width (in character cells).
---                 Minimum of 1.
---               • height: Window height (in character cells).
---                 Minimum of 1.
---               • bufpos: Places float relative to buffer text
---                 (only when relative="win"). Takes a tuple of
---                 zero-indexed [line, column]. `row` and `col` if given are applied relative to this
---                 position, else they default to:
---                 • `row=1` and `col=0` if `anchor` is "NW" or
---                   "NE"
---                 • `row=0` and `col=0` if `anchor` is "SW" or
---                   "SE" (thus like a tooltip near the buffer
---                   text).
---
---               • row: Row position in units of "screen cell
---                 height", may be fractional.
---               • col: Column position in units of "screen cell
---                 width", may be fractional.
---               • focusable: Enable focus by user actions
---                 (wincmds, mouse events). Defaults to true.
---                 Non-focusable windows can be entered by
---                 |nvim_set_current_win()|.
---               • external: GUI should display the window as an
---                 external top-level window. Currently accepts
---                 no other positioning configuration together
---                 with this.
---               • zindex: Stacking order. floats with higher `zindex` go on top on floats with lower indices. Must
---                 be larger than zero. The following screen
---                 elements have hard-coded z-indices:
---                 • 100: insert completion popupmenu
---                 • 200: message scrollback
---                 • 250: cmdline completion popupmenu (when
---                   wildoptions+=pum) The default value for
---                   floats are 50. In general, values below 100
---                   are recommended, unless there is a good
---                   reason to overshadow builtin elements.
---
---               • style: Configure the appearance of the window.
---                 Currently only takes one non-empty value:
---                 • "minimal" Nvim will display the window with
---                   many UI options disabled. This is useful
---                   when displaying a temporary float where the
---                   text should not be edited. Disables
---                   'number', 'relativenumber', 'cursorline',
---                   'cursorcolumn', 'foldcolumn', 'spell' and
---                   'list' options. 'signcolumn' is changed to
---                   `auto` and 'colorcolumn' is cleared. The
---                   end-of-buffer region is hidden by setting
---                   `eob` flag of 'fillchars' to a space char,
---                   and clearing the |EndOfBuffer| region in
---                   'winhighlight'.
---
---               • border: Style of (optional) window border.
---                 This can either be a string or an array. The
---                 string values are
---                 • "none": No border (default).
---                 • "single": A single line box.
---                 • "double": A double line box.
---                 • "rounded": Like "single", but with rounded
---                   corners ("╭" etc.).
---                 • "solid": Adds padding by a single whitespace
---                   cell.
---                 • "shadow": A drop shadow effect by blending
---                   with the background.
---                 • If it is an array, it should have a length
---                   of eight or any divisor of eight. The array
---                   will specifify the eight chars building up
---                   the border in a clockwise fashion starting
---                   with the top-left corner. As an example, the
---                   double box style could be specified as [
---                   "╔", "═" ,"╗", "║", "╝", "═", "╚", "║" ]. If
---                   the number of chars are less than eight,
---                   they will be repeated. Thus an ASCII border
---                   could be specified as [ "/", "-", "\\", "|"
---                   ], or all chars the same as [ "x" ]. An
---                   empty string can be used to turn off a
---                   specific border, for instance, [ "", "", "",
---                   ">", "", "", "", "<" ] will only make
---                   vertical borders but not horizontal ones. By
---                   default, `FloatBorder` highlight is used,
---                   which links to `WinSeparator` when not
---                   defined. It could also be specified by
---                   character: [ {"+", "MyCorner"}, {"x",
---                   "MyBorder"} ].
---
---               • noautocmd: If true then no buffer-related
---                 autocommand events such as |BufEnter|,
---                 |BufLeave| or |BufWinEnter| may fire from
---                 calling this function.
--- @return any #Window handle, or 0 on error

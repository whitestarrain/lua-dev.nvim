-- 		'wildignorecase' always applies.
--
-- 		When {list} is present and it is |TRUE| the result is a List
-- 		with all matching files. The advantage of using a List is,
-- 		you also get filenames containing newlines correctly.
-- 		Otherwise the result is a String and when there are several
-- 		matches, they are separated by <NL> characters.
--
-- 		If the expansion fails, the result is an empty String or List.

--
-- <		When the 'p' flag is given then there is an extra item with
-- 		the sub-pattern match number |search()-sub-match|.  Example: >

--
-- 		When a match has been found its line number is returned.
-- 		If there is no match a 0 is returned and the cursor doesn't
-- 		move.  No error message is given.
--
-- 		{flags} is a String, which can contain these character flags:
-- 		'b'	search Backward instead of forward
-- 		'c'	accept a match at the Cursor position
-- 		'e'	move to the End of the match
-- 		'n'	do Not move the cursor
-- 		'p'	return number of matching sub-Pattern (see below)
-- 		's'	Set the ' mark at the previous location of the cursor
-- 		'w'	Wrap around the end of the file
-- 		'W'	don't Wrap around the end of the file
-- 		'z'	start searching at the cursor column instead of Zero
-- 		If neither 'w' or 'W' is given, the 'wrapscan' option applies.
--
-- 		If the 's' flag is supplied, the ' mark is set, only if the
-- 		cursor is moved. The 's' flag cannot be combined with the 'n'
-- 		flag.
--
-- 		'ignorecase', 'smartcase' and 'magic' are used.
--
-- 		When the 'z' flag is not given, searching always starts in
-- 		column zero and then matches before the cursor are skipped.
-- 		When the 'c' flag is present in 'cpo' the next search starts
-- 		after the match.  Without the 'c' flag the next search starts
-- 		one column further.
--
-- 		When the {stopline} argument is given then the search stops
-- 		after searching this line.  This is useful to restrict the
-- 		search to a range of lines.  Examples: >
-- 			let match = search('(', 'b', line("w0"))
-- 			let end = search('END', '', line("w$"))
-- <		When {stopline} is used and it is not zero this also implies
-- 		that the search does not wrap around the end of the file.
-- 		A zero value is equal to not giving the argument.
--
-- 		When the {timeout} argument is given the search stops when
-- 		more than this many milliseconds have passed.  Thus when
-- 		{timeout} is 500 the search stops after half a second.
-- 		The value must not be negative.  A zero value is like not
-- 		giving the argument.
--
-- 							*search()-sub-match*
-- 		With the 'p' flag the returned value is one more than the
-- 		first sub-match in \(\).  One if none of them matched but the
-- 		whole pattern did match.
-- 		To get the column number too use |searchpos()|.
--
-- 		The cursor will be positioned at the match, unless the 'n'
-- 		flag is used.
--
-- 		Example (goes over all files in the argument list): >
-- 		    :let n = 1
-- 		    :while n <= argc()	    " loop over all files in arglist
-- 		    :  exe "argument " . n
-- 		    :  " start at the last char in the file and wrap for the
-- 		    :  " first search to find match at start of file
-- 		    :  normal G$
-- 		    :  let flags = "w"
-- 		    :  while search("foo", flags) > 0
-- 		    :	 s/foo/bar/g
-- 		    :	 let flags = "W"
-- 		    :  endwhile
-- 		    :  update		    " write the file if modified
-- 		    :  let n = n + 1
-- 		    :endwhile
-- <
-- 		Example for using some flags: >
-- 		    :echo search('\<if\|\(else\)\|\(endif\)', 'ncpe')
-- <		This will search for the keywords "if", "else", and "endif"
-- 		under or after the cursor.  Because of the 'p' flag, it
-- 		returns 1, 2, or 3 depending on which keyword is found, or 0
-- 		if the search fails.  With the cursor on the first word of the
-- 		line:
-- 		    if (foo == 0) | let foo = foo + 1 | endif ~
-- 		the function returns 1.  Without the 'c' flag, the function
-- 		finds the "endif" and returns 3.  The same thing happens
-- 		without the 'e' flag if the cursor is on the "f" of "if".
-- 		The 'n' flag tells the function not to move the cursor.
--- @return number

-- With no arguments the result is a String, which is the name of

-- Start a job and return a Job object.  Unlike |system()| and

--
-- 		If the job fails to start then |job_status()| on the returned
-- 		Job object results in "fail" and none of the callbacks will be
-- 		invoked.
--
-- 		{command} can be a String.  This works best on MS-Windows.  On
-- 		Unix it is split up in white-separated parts to be passed to
-- 		execvp().  Arguments in double quotes can contain white space.
--
-- 		{command} can be a List, where the first item is the executable
-- 		and further items are the arguments.  All items are converted
-- 		to String.  This works best on Unix.
--
-- 		On MS-Windows, job_start() makes a GUI application hidden. If
-- 		want to show it, Use |:!start| instead.
--
-- 		The command is executed directly, not through a shell, the
-- 		'shell' option is not used.  To use the shell: >
-- 	let job = job_start(["/bin/sh", "-c", "echo hello"])
-- <		Or: >
-- 	let job = job_start('/bin/sh -c "echo hello"')
-- <		Note that this will start two processes, the shell and the
-- 		command it executes.  If you don't want this use the "exec"
-- 		shell command.
--
-- 		On Unix $PATH is used to search for the executable only when
-- 		the command does not contain a slash.
--
-- 		The job will use the same terminal as Vim.  If it reads from
-- 		stdin the job and Vim will be fighting over input, that
-- 		doesn't work.  Redirect stdin and stdout to avoid problems: >
-- 	let job = job_start(['sh', '-c', "myserver </dev/null >/dev/null"])
-- <
-- 		The returned Job object can be used to get the status with
-- 		|job_status()| and stop the job with |job_stop()|.
--
-- 		Note that the job object will be deleted if there are no
-- 		references to it.  This closes the stdin and stderr, which may
-- 		cause the job to fail with an error.  To avoid this keep a
-- 		reference to the job.  Thus instead of: >
-- 	call job_start('my-command')
-- <		use: >
-- 	let myjob = job_start('my-command')
-- <		and unlet "myjob" once the job is not needed or is past the
-- 		point where it would fail (e.g. when it prints a message on
-- 		startup).  Keep in mind that variables local to a function
-- 		will cease to exist if the function returns.  Use a
-- 		script-local variable if needed: >
-- 	let s:myjob = job_start('my-command')
-- <
-- 		{options} must be a Dictionary.  It can contain many optional

-- 		This function is useful for debugging a syntax file.
-- 		Example that shows the syntax stack under the cursor: >

-- 			   echo synIDattr(id, "name")
-- 			endfor
-- <		When the position specified with {lnum} and {col} is invalid

-- Perform glob() on all directories in {path} and concatenate

-- 		To add a comma inside a directory name escape it with a
-- 		backslash.  Note that on MS-Windows a directory may have a
-- 		trailing backslash, remove it if you put a comma after it.
-- 		If the expansion fails for one of the directories, there is no
-- 		error message.
--
-- 		Unless the optional {nosuf} argument is given and is |TRUE|,
-- 		the 'suffixes' and 'wildignore' options apply: Names matching
-- 		one of the patterns in 'wildignore' will be skipped and
-- 		'suffixes' affect the ordering of matches.
--
-- 		When {list} is present and it is |TRUE| the result is a List
-- 		with all matching files. The advantage of using a List is, you
-- 		also get filenames containing newlines correctly. Otherwise

-- 		they are separated by <NL> characters.  Example: >
-- 			:echo globpath(&rtp, "syntax/c.vim", 0, 1)
-- <
-- 		{allinks} is used as with |glob()|.
--
-- 		The "**" item can be used to search in a directory tree.
-- 		For example, to find all "README.txt" files in the directories
-- 		in 'runtimepath' and below: >
-- 			:echo globpath(&rtp, "**/README.txt")
-- <		Upwards search and limiting the depth of "**" is not

-- 		If {item} evaluates to a Number, it will be interpreted as
-- 		an index, see |:history-indexing|.  The respective entry will
-- 		be removed if it exists.
--
-- 		The result is a Number: 1 for a successful operation,

--
-- 		When substitute() is used recursively only the submatches in

-- 		If [expr] is 1, only check if a character is available, it is
-- 			not consumed.  Return zero if no character available.
--
-- 		Without [expr] and when [expr] is 0 a whole character or
-- 		special key is returned.  If it is a single character, the
-- 		result is a number.  Use nr2char() to convert it to a String.
-- 		Otherwise a String is returned with the encoded character.
-- 		For a special key it's a String with a sequence of bytes
-- 		starting with 0x80 (decimal: 128).  This is the same value as
-- 		the String "\<Key>", e.g., "\<Left>".  The returned value is
-- 		also a String when a modifier (shift, control, alt) was used
-- 		that is not included in the character.
--
-- 		When [expr] is 0 and Esc is typed, there will be a short delay
-- 		while Vim waits to see if this is the start of an escape
-- 		sequence.
--
-- 		When [expr] is 1 only the first byte is returned.  For a
-- 		one-byte character it is the character itself as a number.
-- 		Use nr2char() to convert it to a String.
--
-- 		Use getcharmod() to obtain any additional modifiers.
--
-- 		When the user clicks a mouse button, the mouse event will be
-- 		returned.  The position can then be found in |v:mouse_col|,
-- 		|v:mouse_lnum|, |v:mouse_winid| and |v:mouse_win|.  This
-- 		example positions the mouse as it would normally happen: >
-- 			let c = getchar()

-- 			  exe v:mouse_win . "wincmd w"
-- 			  exe v:mouse_lnum

-- 		There is no prompt, you will somehow have to make clear to the

-- 		There is no mapping for the character.
-- 		Key codes are replaced, thus when the user presses the <Del>
-- 		key you get the code for the <Del> key, not the raw character

-- includes an extra item in the list:
-- 		    [bufnum, lnum, col, off, curswant] ~
--  		The "curswant" number is the preferred column when moving the
-- 		cursor vertically.  Also see |getpos()|.
--
--  		This can be used to save and restore the cursor position: >
--  			let save_cursor = getcurpos()
--  			MoveTheCursorAround
--  			call setpos('.', save_cursor)
-- <		Note that this only works within the window.  See
-- 		|winrestview()| for restoring more state.
--- @return list
function vim.fn.getcurpos() end

-- The result is a Number, which is the height of window {nr}.
-- 		{nr} can be the window number or the |window-ID|.
-- 		When {nr} is zero, the height of the current window is
-- 		returned.  When window {nr} doesn't exist, -1 is returned.
-- 		An existing window always has a height of zero or more.
-- 		This excludes any window toolbar line.
-- 		Examples: >
--   :echo "The current window has " . winheight(0) . " lines."

-- Selects the {nr} match item, as set with a |:match|,
-- 		|:2match| or |:3match| command.
-- 		Return a |List| with two elements:
-- 			The name of the highlight group used
-- 			The pattern used.
-- 		When {nr} is not 1, 2 or 3 returns an empty |List|.
-- 		When there is no match item set returns ['', ''].
-- 		This is useful to save and restore a |:match|.
-- 		Highlighting matches using the |:match| commands are limited
-- 		to three matches. |matchadd()| does not have this limitation.
--- @return list
function vim.fn.matcharg(nr) end

-- Same as |matchstr()|, but return the matched string, the start
-- 		position and the end position of the match.  Example: >
-- 			:echo matchstrpos("testing", "ing")
-- <		results in ["ing", 4, 7].
-- 		When there is no match ["", -1, -1] is returned.
-- 		The {start}, if given, has the same meaning as for |match()|. >
-- 			:echo matchstrpos("testing", "ing", 2)
-- <		results in ["ing", 4, 7]. >
-- 			:echo matchstrpos("testing", "ing", 5)
-- <		result is ["", -1, -1].
-- 		When {expr} is a |List| then the matching item, the index
-- 		of first item where {pat} matches, the start position and the
-- 		end position of the match are returned. >
-- 			:echo matchstrpos([1, '__x'], '\a')
-- <		result is ["x", 1, 2, 3].
-- 		The type isn't changed, it's not necessarily a String.
--- @return list
function vim.fn.matchstrpos(expr, pat, start, count) end

-- The result is a Number, which is the current screen row of the
-- 		cursor.  The top line has number one.
-- 		This function is mainly used for testing.
-- 		Alternatively you can use |winline()|.
--
-- 		Note: Same restrictions as with |screencol()|.
--- @return number
function vim.fn.screenrow() end

-- Add the String {item} to the history {history} which can be
-- 		one of:					*hist-names*
-- 			"cmd"	 or ":"	  command line history
-- 			"search" or "/"   search pattern history
-- 			"expr"	 or "="   typed expression history
-- 			"input"  or "@"	  input line history
-- 			"debug"  or ">"   debug command history
-- 			empty		  the current or last used history
-- 		The {history} string does not need to be the whole name, one
-- 		character is sufficient.
-- 		If {item} does already exist in the history, it will be
-- 		shifted to become the newest entry.
-- 		The result is a Number: 1 if the operation was successful,
-- 		otherwise 0 is returned.
--
-- 		Example: >
-- 			:call histadd("input", strftime("%Y %b %d"))
-- 			:let date=input("Enter date: ")
-- <		This function is not available in the |sandbox|.
--- @return string
